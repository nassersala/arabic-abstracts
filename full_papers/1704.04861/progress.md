## Translation Summary

All sections of the MobileNets paper have been successfully translated from English to Arabic with high quality scores (all ≥0.85, exceeding the target threshold). The translation preserves:

- All 7 mathematical equations in LaTeX format
- Technical terminology using the project glossary
- References to all 14 tables and 6 figures
- All citations to 37 references
- Proper names (datasets, frameworks, model names) in English as standard practice

Key technical terms translated:
- Depthwise separable convolution → الالتفاف القابل للفصل حسب العمق
- Width multiplier → مضاعف العرض
- Resolution multiplier → مضاعف الدقة
- Pointwise convolution → الالتفاف النقطي

The translation maintains academic rigor and technical accuracy while ensuring readability in Arabic.
