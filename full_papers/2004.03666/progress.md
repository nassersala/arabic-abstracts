## Translation Summary

This full paper translation of "Compositional Formal Analysis Based on Conventional Engineering Models" (arXiv:2004.03666) was completed successfully with an overall quality score of 0.87, exceeding the required threshold of 0.85.

### Key Achievements:
- All 8 sections translated with consistent terminology
- Technical formal definitions and mathematical notation preserved
- Code listings maintained in English (industry standard)
- Glossary terms used consistently throughout
- Figure and citation references preserved

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **Complex formal definitions**: Section 4 (System Model) contained extensive formal mathematical notation (6-tuples, set notation, formal semantics) that required careful translation while preserving mathematical symbols
2. **Code listings**: Multiple NuSMV code examples were kept in English with Arabic explanations
3. **Technical acronyms**: Many acronyms (SLICED, FSM, ADAPT, NuSMV, AADL, etc.) were handled by keeping English with Arabic explanations
4. **Performance metrics**: Timing results and experimental data kept in original format
