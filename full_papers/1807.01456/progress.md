- **Mathematical notation maintained** in LaTeX format
- **Technical terminology** translated consistently using glossary
- **Benchmark data** preserved with translated headers

### Technical Highlights

1. **Type System (Section 2)**: Translated complex concepts including dependent types, type-level functions, and type-driven casting
2. **Testing (Section 3)**: Explained property-based testing methodology for algebraic correctness
3. **Case Studies (Section 4)**: Covered three Gröbner basis algorithms with benchmark results
4. **Glossary Usage**: Consistently applied terms for functional programming, computer algebra, type systems, and formal methods
