## Summary

This paper translation is now complete. All 7 sections have been translated with high quality scores (all ≥0.85). The paper presents a framework for combining formal methods (TLA+, FocusST, BeSpaceD) with property-based testing to reduce the impedance mismatch between formal methods and practitioners. The translation maintains technical accuracy while ensuring readability in Arabic.

### Key Features:
- Comprehensive coverage of spatio-temporal modeling languages
- Practical examples using Scala and ScalaCheck
- Case studies: Therac-25 radiation machine and VXLab robotics
- Code examples preserved in English with Arabic explanations
- All glossary terms used consistently

### Translation Highlights:
- Human factors engineering concepts
- Property-based vs example-based testing comparison
- Category theory application in framework design
- BeSpaceD formula syntax and semantics
- Future-based asynchronous API testing

**Total Pages Translated:** 11 pages (from original PDF)
**Total Sections:** 7 sections
**Code Examples:** 5 Scala code blocks
**Tables:** 1 evaluation table
**Figures:** 2 figures (framework diagram, VXLab photo)
