## Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in theoretical computer science. It:
- Introduced the concept of NP-completeness
- Proved that SAT (Boolean satisfiability) is NP-complete
- Established polynomial-time reducibility
- Founded the theory of computational complexity classes
- Won Stephen Cook the ACM Turing Award in 1982
