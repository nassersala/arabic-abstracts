## Notes

This is a foundational paper in computational complexity theory. Special attention was given to:
- ✅ Mathematical notation and formal definitions
- ✅ Precise technical terminology (NP, polynomial time, reducibility, tautology, etc.)
- ✅ Theorem statements and proofs
- ✅ Consistency with existing Arabic complexity theory terminology

**Historical Significance:** This paper introduced NP-completeness and earned Cook the Turing Award in 1982. It is one of the most influential papers in theoretical computer science.
