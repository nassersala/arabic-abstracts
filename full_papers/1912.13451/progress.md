# Translation Progress: Introduction to Rank-polymorphic Programming in Remora

**arXiv ID:** 1912.13451
**Started:** 2025-11-17
**Status:** In Progress
**Paper Length:** 52 pages

## Overview

This is a tutorial paper introducing the Remora programming language and the rank-polymorphic computational model. Due to its tutorial nature, the paper is organized into logical teaching sections rather than traditional research paper sections.

## Sections

- [x] 00-abstract.md
- [x] 01-introduction.md
- [x] 02-arrays-basics.md (Everything is an array, array syntax)
- [ ] 03-functions-frames.md (Functions operate on cells, frame distribution)
- [ ] 04-advanced-ops.md (Reduce, scan, fold, reranking, matrix operations)
- [ ] 05-conditionals-indexing.md (Conditional code, indexing, subarrays)
- [ ] 06-type-system.md (Explicitly typed Remora, types and indices)
- [ ] 07-advanced-types.md (Boxes, existential types, dynamic shapes)
- [ ] 08-references.md (Translate reference titles only)

**Overall Translation Quality (so far):** 0.87 (average of completed sections)
**Estimated Completion:** 33% (3/9 sections completed)

## Notes

- This is a 52-page tutorial paper with extensive code examples
- Focus on maintaining technical accuracy of programming concepts
- Keep all code examples in English (standard practice)
- Translate explanatory text and comments
- Use glossary consistently for: array (مصفوفة), rank (رتبة), shape (شكل), frame (إطار), cell (خلية)

## Translation Strategy

1. Each section will include full English text and Arabic translation
2. Code examples preserved in English with Arabic explanations
3. Mathematical notation preserved as-is
4. Back-translate key paragraphs for quality verification
5. Target quality score: ≥0.85 for all sections
