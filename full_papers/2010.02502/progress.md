## Translation Notes

- Paper introduces DDIMs, a generalization of DDPMs using non-Markovian processes
- Heavy mathematical content with variational inference and probability theory
- Key contribution: 10-50x faster sampling than DDPMs
- Requires careful handling of mathematical notation and probabilistic terms
