1. Introduction 
The demand for privacy of digital data and of algor ithms for handling more complex 
structures have increased exponentially over the la st decade. This goes in parallel with the 
growth in communication networks and their devices and their increasing capabilities (Sen, 
2013a; Sen, 2012d; Sen, 2012c; Bandyopadhyay & Sen,  2011; Sen, 2011b; Sen, 2011c; Sen, 
2010c). At the same time, these devices and network s are subject to a great variety of attacks 
involving manipulation and destruction of data and theft of sensitive information (Sen, 
2013b; Sen, 2012e; Sen, 2011d; Sen, 2010d; Sen et a l., 2007a; Sen et al., 2007b; Sen et al., 2007c; 
Sen et al., 2006). For storing and accessing data s ecurely, current technology provides 
several methods of guaranteeing privacy such as dat a encryption and usage of tamper-
resistant hardwares. However, the critical problem arises when there is a requirement for 
computing (publicly) with private data or to modify  functions or algorithms in such a way 
that they are still executable while their privacy is ensured. This is where homomorphic 
cryptosystems can be used since these systems enabl e computations with encrypted data.  
In 1978 Rivest et al. (Rivest et al, 1978a) first inv estigated the design of a homomorphic 
encryption scheme. Unfortunately, their privacy homomorphism  was broken a couple of years 
later by Brickell and Yacobi (Brickell & Yacobi, 19 87). The question rose again in 1991 when 
Feigenbaum and Merritt (Feigenbaum & Merritt, 1991)  raised an important question: is there 
an encryption function (E) such that both E(x + y) and E(x.y) are easy to compute from E(x) and 
E(y)?  Essentially, the question is intended to investiga te whether there is any algebraically 
homomorphic encryption scheme that can be designed.  Unfortunately, there has been a very 
little progress in determining whether such encrypt ion schemes exist that are efficient and 
secure until 2009 when Craig Gentry, in his seminal  paper, theoretically demonstrated the 
possibility of construction such an encryption syst em (Gentry, 2009). In this chapter, we will 
discuss various aspects of homomorphic encryption s chemes – their definitions, 
requirements, applications, formal constructions, a nd the limitations of the current 
homomorphic encryption schemes. We will also briefl y discuss some of the emerging trends 
in research in this field of computer science.   
The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some basic and fundamental 
information on cryptography and various types of en cryption schemes. Section 3 presents a 
formal discussion on homomorphic encryption schemes  and discusses their various 
features. In Section 4, we discuss some of the most  well-known and classical homomorphic 
encryption schemes in the literature. Section 5 pro vides a brief presentation on various 
properties and applications of homomorphic cryptosy stems. Section 6 presents a discussion 
on fully homomorphic encryption schemes which are t he most powerful encryption 
schemes for providing a framework for computing ove r encrypted data. Finally, Section 7 
concludes the chapter while outlining a number of r esearch directions and emerging trends

in this exciting filed of computation which has a t remendous potential of finding 
applications in the real-world deployments.  
2. Fundamentals of Cryptography 
In this Section, we will recall some important conc epts on encryption schemes. For more 
detailed information, the reader may refer to (Mene zes et al., 1997; Van Tilborg, 2011). 
Encryption schemes are designed to preserve confide ntiality. The security of encryption 
schemes must not rely on the obfuscation of their c odes, but it should only be based on the 
secrecy of the key used in the encryption process. Encryption schemes are broadly of two 
types: symmetric  and asymmetric  encryption schemes. In the following, we present a  very 
brief discussion on each of these schemes. 
Symmetric encryption schemes : In these schemes, the sender and the receiver agr ee on the 
key they will use before establishing any secure co mmunication session. Therefore, it is not 
possible for two persons who never met before to us e such schemes directly. This also 
implies that in order to communicate with different  persons, we must have a different key 
for each people. Requirement of large number of keys  in these schemes make their key 
generation and management relatively more complex o perations. However, symmetric 
schemes present the advantage of being very fast an d they are used in applications where 
speed of execution is a paramount requirement. Amon g the existing symmetric encryption 
systems, AES (Daemen & Rijmen, 2000; Daemen & Rijmen,  2002), One-Time Pad (Vernam, 
1926) and Snow (Ekdahl & Johansson, 2002) are very popular. 
Asymmetric encryption schemes:  In these schemes, every participant has a pair of keys- 
private and public. While the private key of a pers on is known to only her, the public key of 
each participant is known to everyone in the group.  Such schemes are more secure than 
their symmetric counterparts and they don’t need an y prior agreement between the 
communicating parties on a common key before establ ishing a session of communication. 
RSA (Rivest et al., 1978b) and ElGamal (ElGamal, 1985 ) are two most popular asymmetric 
encryption systems.  
Security of encryption schemes:  Security of encryption schemes was first formalize d by 
Shannon (Shannon, 1949). In his seminal paper, Shan non first introduced the notion of 
perfect secrecy/unconditional secrecy, which charac terizes encryption schemes for which 
the knowledge of a ciphertext does not give any inf ormation about the corresponding 
plaintext and the encryption key. Shannon also prov ed that One-Time Pad (Vernam, 1926) 
encryption scheme is perfectly secure under certain  conditions. However, no other 
encryption scheme has been proved to be uncondition ally secure. For asymmetric schemes, 
we can rely on their mathematical structures to est imate their security strength in a formal 
way. These schemes are based on some well-identifie d mathematical problems which are 
hard to solve in general, but easy to solve for the  one who knows the trapdoor – i.e., the 
owner of the keys. However, the estimation of the s ecurity level of these schemes may not 
be always correct due to several reasons. First, th ere may be other ways to break the system 
than solving the mathematical problems on which the se schemes are based (Ajtai & Dwork, 
1997; Nguyen & Stern, 1999). Second, most of the se curity proofs are performed in an 
idealized model called random oracle model , in which involved primitives, for example, hash 
functions, are considered truly random. This model has allowed the study of the security 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 3
level of numerous asymmetric ciphers. However, we a re now able to perform proofs in a 
more realistic model called standard model  (Canetti et al., 1998; Paillier, 2007). This model  
eliminates some of the unrealistic assumptions in t he random oracle model and makes the 
security analysis of cryptographic schemes more pra ctical.  
Usually, to evaluate the attack capacity of an adve rsary, we distinguish among several 
contexts (Diffie & Hellman, 1976): cipher-text only attacks  (where the adversary has access 
only to some ciphertexts), known-plaintext attacks  (where the adversary has access to some 
pairs of plaintext messages and their corresponding  ciphertexts), chosen-plaintext attacks  (the 
adversary has access to a decryption oracle that be haves like a black-box and takes a 
ciphertext as its input and outputs the correspondi ng plaintexts). The first context is the 
most frequent in real-world since it can happen whe n some adversary eavesdrops on a 
communication channel. The other cases may seem dif ficult to achieve, and may arise when 
the adversary is in a more powerful position; he ma y, for example, have stolen some 
plaintexts or an encryption engine. The chosen  one exists in adaptive versions, where the 
opponents can wait for a computation result before choosing the next input (Fontaine & 
Galand, 2007). 
Probabilistic encryption: Almost all the well-known cryptosystems are deterministic . This 
means that for a fixed encryption key, a given plai ntext will always be encrypted into the 
same ciphertext under these systems. However, this may lead to some security problems. 
RSA scheme is a good example for explaining this poi nt. Let us consider the following 
points with reference to the RSA cryptosystem: 
• A particular plaintext may be encrypted in a too mu ch structured way. With RSA, 
messages 0 and 1 are always encrypted as 0 and 1, r espectively. 
• It may be easy to compute some partial information about the plaintext: with RSA, 
the ciphertext c leaks one bit of information about the plaintext m, namely, the so 
called Jacobi symbol (Fontaine & Galand, 2007). 
• When using a deterministic encryption scheme, it is  easy to detect when the same 
message is sent twice while processed with the same  key. 
In view of the problems stated above, we prefer enc ryption schemes to be probabilistic. In 
case of symmetric schemes, we introduce a random ve ctor in the encryption process (e.g., in 
the pseudo-random generator for stream ciphers, or in the operating mode for block 
ciphers) – generally called initial vector  (IV). This vector may be public and it may be 
transmitted in a clear-text form. However, the IV m ust be changed every time we encrypt a 
message. In case of asymmetric ciphers, the securit y analysis is more mathematical and 
formal, and we want the randomized schemes to remai n analyzable in the same way as the 
deterministic schemes. Researchers have proposed som e models to randomize the existing 
deterministic schemes, as the optimal asymmetric encryption padding  (OAEP) for RSA (or any 
scheme that is based on a trapdoor one-way permutat ion) (Bellare & Rogaway, 1995). In the 
literature, researchers have also proposed some oth er randomized schemes (ElGamal, 1985; 
Goldwasser & Micali, 1982; Blum & Goldwasser, 1985) . 
A simple consequence of this requirement of the enc ryption schemes to be preferably 
probabilistic appears in the phenomenon called expansion . Since for a plaintext we require 
the existence of several possible ciphertexts, the number of ciphertexts is greater than the 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies

number of possible plaintexts. This means the ciphe rtexts cannot be as short as the 
plaintexts; they have to be strictly longer. The ra tio of the length of the ciphertext and the 
corresponding plaintext (in bits) is called expansi on. The value of this parameter is of 
paramount importance in determining security and efficiency tradeoff  of a probabilistic 
encryption scheme. In Paillier’s scheme, an efficie nt probabilistic encryption mechanism has 
been proposed with the value of expansion less than  2 (Paillier, 1997). We will see the 
significance of expansion in other homomorphic encr yption systems in the subsequent 
sections of this chapter.   
3. Homomorphic Encryption Schemes 
During the last few years, homomorphic encryption s chemes have been studied extensively 
since they have become more and more important in m any different cryptographic 
protocols such as, e.g., voting protocols. In this Section, we introduce homomorphic 
cryptosystems in three steps: what , how  and why  that reflects the main aspects of this 
interesting encryption technique. We start by defin ing homomorphic cryptosystems and 
algebraically homomorphic cryptosystems. Then we de velop a method to construct 
algebraically homomorphic schemes given special hom omorphic schemes. Finally, we 
describe applications of homomorphic schemes.  
Definition:  Let the message space ( M, o) be a finite (semi-)group, and let σ be the sec urity 
parameter. A homomorphic public-key encryption scheme  (or homomorphic cryptosystem ) on M is 
a quadruple ( K, E, D, A) of probabilistic, expected polynomial time algori thms, satisfying the 
following functionalities: 
• Key Generation:  On input 1 σ the algorithm K outputs an encryption/decryption 
key pair ( ℤg2193ℤg2187ℤuni002Cℤg2193ℤg2186ℤg4667 ℤg3404 ℤg2193 ℤg1488 ℤg2167ℤuni002C  where ℤg2167 denotes the key space. 
• Encryption:  On inputs 1 σ, ke , and an element ℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2169ℤuni0020the encryption algorithm E 
outputs a ciphertext ℤg1855ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2159ℤuni0020ℤuni002Cℤuni0020where ℤg2159 denotes the ciphertext space. 
• Decryption:  The decryption algorithm D is deterministic. On inputs 1 σ, k, and an 
element ℤg1855ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2159ℤuni0020it outputs an element in the message space M so that for all ℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488
ℤg2169ℤuni0020ℤuni0069ℤuni0074ℤuni0020ℤuni0068ℤuni006Fℤuni006Cℤuni0064ℤuni0073ℤuni003Aℤuni0020   if ℤuni0020c = E(1 ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg4667 then ℤg1842ℤg1870ℤg1867ℤg1854ℤg4670ℤg1830ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg4667 ℤg3405 ℤg1865ℤg4671  is negligible, i.e., it holds 
that ℤg1842ℤg1870ℤg1867ℤg1854 ℤg4670ℤg1830ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg4667ℤg3405 ℤg1865ℤg4671ℤg3409ℤuni0020ℤuni0032ℤg2879ℤg3097. 
• Homomorphic Property:  A is an algorithm that on inputs ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni0020, and elements 
ℤg1855ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg2870ℤuni0020ℤuni0020ℤg1488 ℤg2159ℤuni0020outputs an element ℤg1855ℤg2871ℤuni0020ℤg1488 ℤg2159 so that for all ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2870ℤuni0020ℤuni0020ℤg1488 ℤg2169ℤuni0020it holds: if ℤg1865ℤg2871ℤg3404
ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni0020ℤg1867ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg2870 and ℤg1855ℤg2869ℤg3404 ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2869ℤg4667, and ℤg1855ℤg2870ℤg3404 ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667, then 
ℤg1842ℤg1870ℤg1867ℤg1854ℤg3427ℤg1830ℤg3435ℤg1827 ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg2870ℤg4667ℤg3439ℤg3431 ℤg3405ℤuni0020ℤg1865 ℤg2871ℤg4671 is negligible.  
Informally speaking, a homomorphic cryptosystem is a cryptosystem with the additional 
property that there exists an efficient algorithm t o compute an encryption of the sum or the 
product, of two messages given the public key and t he encryptions of the messages but not 
the messages themselves.  
If M is an additive (semi-)group, then the scheme is ca lled additively homomorphic  and the 
algorithms A is called Add Otherwise, the scheme is called multiplicatively homomorphic  and 
the algorithm A is called Mult .  
With respect to the aforementioned definitions, the  following points are worth noticing: 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 5
• For a homomorphic encryption scheme to be efficient , it is crucial to make sure that 
the size of the ciphertexts remains polynomially bo unded in the security parameter 
σ during repeated computations. 
• The security aspects, definitions, and models of ho momorphic cryptosystems are 
the same as those for other cryptosystems. 
If the encryption algorithm E gets as additional input a uniform random number r of a set ℤℤ ℤℤ, 
the encryption scheme is called probabilistic , otherwise, it is called deterministic . Hence, if a 
cryptosystem is probabilistic, there belong several  different ciphertexts to one message 
depending on the random number ℤg1870ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤuni0020ℤ. But note that as before the decryption algorithm 
remains deterministic, i.e., there is just one mess age belonging to a given ciphertext. 
Furthermore, in a probabilistic, homomorphic crypto system the algorithm A should be 
probabilistic too to hide the input ciphertext. For  instance, this can be realized by applying a 
blinding algorithm  on a (deterministic) computation of the encryption  of the product and of 
the sum respectively. 
Notations:  In the following, we will omit the security parame ter σ and the public key in the 
description of the algorithms. We will write ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg4667 or E(m)  for ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg4667 and ℤg1830ℤg3038ℤg4666ℤg1855ℤg4667 or 
D(c)  for ℤg1830ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤuni002Cℤg1855ℤg4667 when there is no possibility of any ambiguity. If the scheme is 
probabilistic, we will also write ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg4667 or E(m)  as well as ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4667 or E(m, r)  for

algorithm A (either Add  or Mult ) is applied on two encryptions of the messages ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg4593ℤuni0020ℤg1488
ℤg4666ℤg2169ℤuni002Cℤg1867ℤg4667 and outputs an encryption of ℤg1865ℤuni0020ℤg1867ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg4593, i.e., it holds  that except with negligible 
probability:

Example:  In the following, we give an example of a determin istic multiplicatively 
homomorphic scheme and an example of a probabilisti c, additively homomorphic scheme.  
The RSA Scheme:  The classical RSA scheme (Rivest et al., 1987b) is a n example of a 
deterministic multiplicatively homomorphic cryptosy stem on ℤg2169 ℤg3404 ℤg4666ℤℤuni002Fℤg1840ℤℤuni002Cℤuni002Eℤg4667 , where N is the 
product of two large primes. As ciphertext space, w e have ℤg2159 ℤg3404 ℤg4666ℤℤuni002Fℤg1840ℤℤuni002Cℤuni002Eℤg4667  and as key space 
we have ℤg2167 ℤg3404 ℤg3419ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3031ℤg4667ℤg3404 ℤg3435ℤg4666ℤg1840ℤuni002Cℤg1857ℤg4667ℤuni002Cℤg1856ℤg3439ℤg3627ℤuni0020ℤg1840 ℤg3404 ℤg1868ℤg1869ℤuni002Cℤg1857ℤg1856ℤuni0020 ℤg1568 ℤuni0031ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg2030ℤg4666ℤg1840ℤg4667ℤg4669 . The encryption of a message 
ℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2169 is defined as ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg4667ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg3032ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840 for decryption of a  ciphertext ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg4667ℤg3404 ℤuni0020ℤg1855ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2159 we 
compute ℤg1830ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤuni002Cℤg3038ℤg3279ℤg4666ℤg1855ℤg4667ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤuni0020ℤg1855ℤg3031ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840 ℤg3404 ℤg1865ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840ℤuni002Eℤuni0020 Obviously, the encryption of the product of two 
messages can be efficiently computed by multiplying  the corresponding ciphertexts, i.e.,   
ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Eℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667ℤg3404 ℤg4666ℤg1865 ℤg2869ℤuni002Eℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667ℤg3032ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840 ℤg3404 ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤg3032ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg3032ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840 ℤg4667ℤg3404 ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤg4667ℤuni002Eℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667 
where ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg1488 ℤg2169ℤuni002Eℤuni0020 Therefore, the algorithm for Mult can be easiliy realized as follows:

Usually in the RSA scheme as well as in most of the cryptosystems which are based on the 
difficulty of factoring the security parameter σ is  the bit length of N. For instance, σ = 1024 is 
a common security parameter.

In the above equation, ℤg1870ℤg2871ℤg2870ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1840 is equivalent to ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤuni0030ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg2871ℤg4667. Also, ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg1488 ℤg2169  and ℤg1870ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg2870,ℤg1870ℤg2871ℤuni0020ℤg1488
ℤuni0020ℤg2182ℤuni002E Note that this algorithm should be probabilistic, since it obtains a random number ℤg1870ℤg2871 as 
an additional input.  
A public-key homomorphic encryption scheme on a (se mi-)ring ( M, +, .) can be defined in a 
similar manner. Such schemes consist of two algorit hms: Add  and Mult  for the 
homomorphic property instead of one algorithm for A, i.e., it is additively and 
multiplicatively homomorphic at the same time. Such  schemes are called algebraically 
homomorphic .  
Definition:  An additively homomorphic encryption scheme on a ( semi-)ring ( M, +, .) is 
called scalar homomorphic  if there exists a probabilistic, expected polynomi al time algorithm

that for all ℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2169ℤuni0020 it holds that:  if ℤg1865ℤg4593ℤg3404 ℤg1871ℤuni002Eℤg1865 and ℤg1855 ℤg3404 ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg4667 then the probability

Thus in a scalar homomorphic scheme, it is possible  to compute an encryption 
ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1871ℤuni002Eℤg1865ℤg4667ℤg3404 ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤuni0031ℤg3097ℤuni002Cℤg1863ℤg3032ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg4593ℤg4667 of a product of two messages ℤg1871ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2169  given the public key ℤg1863ℤg3032

It is clear that any scheme that is algebraically h omomorphic is scalar homomorphic as well.

For instance, in a probabilistic, homomorphic crypt osystem on ( M, o) the blinding algorithm 
can be realized by applying the algorithm A on the ciphertext c and an encryption of the 
identity element in M.  

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 7
If M is isomorphic to ℤℤuni002Fℤg1866ℤ  if M is finite or to ℤ otherwise, then the algorithm Mixed_Mult  
can easily be implemented using a double and Add  algorithm. This is combined with a 
blinding algorithm is the scheme is probabilistic ( Cramer et al., 2000). Hence, every 
additively homomorphic cryptosystem on ℤℤuni002Fℤg1866ℤ or ℤ is also scalar homomorphic  and the 
algorithm Mixed_Mult  can be efficiently implemented (Sander & Tschudin,  1998).  
Algebraically Homomorphic Cryptosystems: The existence of an efficient and secure 
algebraically homomorphic cryptosystem has been a l ong standing open question. In this 
Section, we first present some related work conside ring this problem. Thereafter, we 
describe the relationship between algebraically hom omorphic schemes and homomorphic 
schemes on special non-abelian groups. More precise ly, we prove that a homomorphic 
encryption scheme on the non-ableain group ( S7, .), the symmetric group on seven elements, 
allows to construct an algebraically homomorphic en cryption scheme on ( F2, +, .). An 
algebraically homomorphic encryption scheme on ( F2, +, .) can also be obtained from a 
homomorphic encryption scheme on the special linear  group ( SL (3, 2) , .) over F2. 
Furthermore, using coding theory, an algebraically homomorphic encryption on an 
arbitrary finite ring or field could be obtained gi ven a homomorphic encryption scheme on 
one of these non-abelian groups. These observations  could be a first step to solve the 
problem whether efficient and secure algebraically homomorphic schemes exist. The 
research community in cryptography has spent substa ntial effort on this problem. In 1996, 
Boneh and Lipton proved that under a reasonable ass umption every deterministic, 
algebraically homomorphic cryptosystem can be broke n in sub-exponential time (Boneh & 
Lipton, 1996). This may be perceived as a negative result concerning the existence of an 
algebraically homomorphic encryption scheme, althou gh most of the existing 
cryptosystems, e.g., RSA scheme or the ElGamal schem e can be also be broken in sub-
exponential time. Furthermore, if we seek for algeb raically homomorphic public-key 
schemes on small fields or rings such as M = F2, obviously such a scheme has to be 
probabilistic in order to be secure.  
Some researchers also tried to find candidates for algebraically homomorphic schemes. In 
1993, Fellows and Koblitz presented an algebraic pu blic-key cryptosystem called Polly 
Cracker (Fellows & Koblitz, 1993). It is algebraica lly homomorphic and provably secure. 
Unfortunately, the scheme has a number of difficult ies and is not efficient concerning the 
ciphertext length. Firstly, Polly Cracker is a poly nomial-based system. Therefore, computing 
an encryption of the product ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Eℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667 of two messages ℤg1865ℤg2869 and ℤg1865ℤg2870 by multiplying the 
corresponding ciphertext polynomials ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤg4667 and ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg4667, leads to an exponential blowup in 
the number of monomials. Hence, during repeated com putations, there is an exponential 
blow up in the ciphertext length.  Secondly, all ex isting instantiations of Polly Cracker suffer 
from further drawbacks (Koblitz, 1998). They are ei ther insecure since they succumb to 
certain attacks, they are too inefficient to be pra ctical, or they lose the algebraically 
homomorphic property. Hence, it is far from clear h ow such kind of schemes could be 
turned into efficient and secure algebraically homo morphic encryption schemes. A detailed 
analysis and description of these schemes can be fo und in (Ly, 2002).  
In 2002, J. Domingo-Ferrer developed a probabilisti c, algebraically homomorphic secret-key 
cryptosystem (Domingo-Ferrer, 2002). However, this scheme was not efficient since there 
was an exponential blowup in the ciphertext length during repeated multiplications that 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies

were required to be performed. Moreover, it was als o broken by Wagner and Bao (Bao, 2003; 
Wagner, 2003).  
Thus considering homomorphic encryption schemes on groups instead of rings seems more 
promising to design a possible algebraically homomo rphic encryption scheme. It brings us 
closer to structures that have been successfully us ed in cryptography. The following 
theorem shows that indeed the search for algebraica lly homomorphic schemes can be 
reduced to the search for homomorphic schemes on sp ecial non-abelian groups (Rappe, 
2004). 
Theorem I:  The following two statements are equivalent: (1) T here exists an algebraically 
homomorphic encryption scheme on ( F2, +, .). (2) There exists a homomorphic encryption 
scheme on the symmetric group ( S7, .). 
Proof: 1 /barb2right/barb2right /barb2right/barb2right 2: This direction of proof follows immediately and it  holds for an arbitrary finite 
group since operations of finite groups can always be implemented by Boolean circuits. Let 
S7 be represented as a subset of {0, 1} l, where e.g. l = 21 can be chosen, and let C be a circuit 
with addition and multiplication gates that takes a s inputs the binary representations of 
elements ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤuni002Cℤg1865ℤg2870ℤg1488 ℤg1845ℤg2875 and outputs the binary representations of ℤg1865ℤg2869ℤg1865ℤg2870. If we have an 
algebraically homomorphic encryption scheme ( K, E, D, Add, Mult ) on ( F2, +, .) then we can 
define a homomorphic encryption scheme ℤg4666ℤg1837ℤuni002Cℤg3561ℤuni0020ℤg1831ℤuni002Cℤg3561ℤg1830ℤuni002Cℤg3561ℤg1839ℤg1873ℤg1864ℤg1872ℤg4667ℤg3563 on S7 by defining ℤg1831ℤuni0020ℤg3561ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤg4667ℤg3404
ℤg4666ℤg1831ℤg4666ℤg1871ℤg2868ℤg4667ℤuni002Cℤuni2026ℤuni002Eℤg1831ℤg4666ℤg1871ℤg3039ℤg2879ℤg2869ℤg4667ℤg4667 where ℤg4666ℤg1871ℤg2868ℤuni002Cℤuni2026ℤuni2026ℤuni002Eℤuni002Eℤg1871 ℤg3039ℤg2879ℤg2869ℤg4667 denotes the binary representation of m. ℤg1839ℤg1873ℤg1864ℤg1872 ℤg3563 is 
constructed by substituting the addition gates in C by Add  and the multiplication gates by 
Mult . ℤg1837ℤg3561 and ℤg1830ℤg3561 are defined in the obvious way. 
2 /barb2right/barb2right /barb2right/barb2right 1: The proof has two steps. First, we use a construct ion of Ben-Or and Cleve (Ben-Or & 
Cleve, 1992) to show that the field ( F2, +, .) can be encoded in the special linear group 
(SL( 3,2 ), .) over F2. Then, we apply a theorem from projective geometry  to show that 
(SL (3,2), .) is a subgroup of S7. This proves the claim. 
Homomorphic encryption schemes on groups have been extensively studied. For instance, 
we have homomorphic schemes on groups ( ℤℤuni002Fℤg1839ℤℤuni002Cℤg3397ℤg4667 , for M being a smooth number 
(Goldwasser & Micali, 1984; Benaloh, 1994; Naccache  & Stern, 1998) for M = p.q being an 
RSA modulus (Paillier, 1999; Galbraith, 2002), and f or groups ( ℤg4666ℤℤuni002Fℤg1840ℤℤg4667ℤuni0020ℤg1499ℤuni002Cℤuni002Eℤg4667 where N is an 
RSA modulus. All known efficient and secure schemes are homomorphic on abelian groups. 
However, S7 and SL (3, 2) are non-abelian. Sander, Young and Yung (San der et al., 1999) 
investigated the possibility of existence of a homo morphic encryption scheme on non-
abelain groups. Although non-abelian groups had bee n used to construct encryption 
schemes (Ko et al., 2000; Paeng et al., 2001; Wagne r & Magyarik, 1985; Grigoriev & 
Ponomarenko, 2006), the resulting schemes are not h omomorphic in the sense that we need 
for computing efficiently on encrypted data.  
Grigoriev and Ponomarenko propose a novel definitio n of homomorphic cryptosystems on 
which they base a method to construct homomorphic c ryptosystems over arbitrary finite 
groups including non-abelian groups (Grigoriev & Po nomarenko, 2006). Their construction 
method is based on the fact that every finite group  is an epimorphic image of a free product 
of finite cyclic groups. It uses existing homomorph ic encryption schemes on finite cyclic 
groups as building blocks to obtain homomorphic enc ryption schemes on arbitrary finite 
groups. Since the ciphertext space obtained from th e encryption scheme is a free product of 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 9
groups, an exponential blowup of the ciphertext len gths during repeated computations is 
produced as a result. The reason is that the length  of the product of two elements x and y of 
a free product is, in general, the sum of the lengt h of x and the length of y. Hence, the 
technique proposed by Grigoriev and Ponomarenko suf fers from the same drawback as the 
earlier schemes and does not provide an efficient c ryptosystem. We note that using this 
construction it is possible to construct a homomorp hic encryption scheme on the symmetric 
group S7 and on the special linear group SL (3, 2). If we combine this with Theorem 1 , we 
can construct an algebraically homomorphic cryptosy stem on the finite field ( F2, +, .). 
Unfortunately, the exponential blowup owing to the construction method in the 
homomorphic encryption scheme on S7 and on SL (3, 2) respectively, would lead to an 
exponential blowup in F2 and hence leaves the question open if an efficient  algebraically 
homomorphic cryptosystem on F2 exists. We will come back to this issue in Section  6, where 
we discuss fully homomorphic encryption schemes .  
Grigoriev and Ponomarenko propose another method to  encrypt arbitrary finite groups 
homomorphically (Grigoriev & Ponomarenko, 2004). Th is method is based on the difficulty 
of the membership problem for groups of integer mat rices, while in (Grigoriev & 
Ponomarenko, 2006) it is based on the difficulty of  factoring. However, as before, this 
scheme is not efficient. Moreover, in (Grigoriev & Ponomarenko, 2004), an algebraically 
homomorphic cryptosystem over finite commutative ri ngs is proposed. However, owing to 
its immense size, it is infeasible to implement in real-world applications. 
4. Some Classical Homomorphic Encryption Systems 
In this Section, we describe some classical homomor phic encryption systems which have 
created substantial interest among the researchers in the domain of cryptography. We start 
with the first probabilistic systems proposed by Go ldwasser and Micali in 1982 (Goldwasser 
& Micali, 1982; Goldwasser & Micali, 1984) and then  discuss the famous Paillier’s encryption 
scheme (Paillier, 1999) and its improvements. Paill ier’s scheme and its variants are well-
known for their efficiency and the high level of se curity that they provide for homomorphic 
encryption. We do not discuss their mathematical co nsiderations in detail, but summarize 
their important parameters and properties.  
Goldwasser-Micali scheme: This scheme (Goldwasser & Micali, 1982; Goldwasser & Micali, 
1984) is historically very important since many of subsequent proposals on homomorphic 
encryption were largely motivated by its approach. Like in RSA, in this scheme, we use 
computations modulo n = p.q, a product of two large primes. The encryption pro cess is 
simple which uses a product and a square, whereas d ecryption is heavier and involves 
exponentiation. The complexity of the decryption pr ocess is: ℤg1841ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤuni002Eℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1868ℤg4667ℤg2870ℤg4667, where ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1868ℤg4667 denotes 
the number of bits in p. Unfortunately, this scheme has a limitation since  its input consist of 
a single bit. First, this implies that encrypting k bits leads to a cost of ℤg1841ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤuni002Eℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1868ℤg4667ℤg2870ℤg4667. This is not 
very efficient even if it may be considered as prac tical. The second concern is related to the 
issue of expansion  – a single bit of plaintext is encrypted in an integer modulo  n, that is, ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667 
bits. This leads to a huge blow up of ciphertext ca using a serious problem with this scheme. 
Goldwasser-Micali (GM) scheme can be viewed from an other perspective. When looked 
from this angle, the basic principle of this scheme  is to partition a well-chosen subset of 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies 
10  
integers modulo n into two secret parts: ℤg1839ℤg2868 and ℤg1839ℤg2869. The encryption process selects a random 
element ℤg1839ℤg3029 to encrypt plaintext b, and the decryption process lets the user know in which 
part the randomly selected element lies. The essenc e of the scheme lies in the mechanism to 
determine the subset, and to partition it into ℤg1839ℤg2868 and ℤg1839ℤg2869. The scheme uses group theory to 
achieve this goal. The subset is the group G of invertible integers modulo n with a Jacobi 
symbol with respect to n, equal to 1. The partition is generated by another  group ℤg1834 ℤg1599 ℤg1833, 
consisting of the elements that are invertible modu lo n with a Jacobi symbol, with respect to 
a fixed factor n, equal to 1. W ith these settings of parameters, it is possible to  split G into two 
parts – H and G\H. The generalization schemes of GM deal with these two groups. These 
schemes attempt to find two groups G and H such that G can be split into more than k = 2 
parts.  
Benaloh’s scheme: Benaloh (Benaloh, 1988) is a generalization of GM s cheme that enables 
one to manage inputs of ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg4667 bits, k being a prime satisfying some specified constraint s. 
Encryption is similar as in GM scheme (encrypting a  message ℤg1865ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg4668ℤuni0030ℤuni002Cℤuni2026ℤuni002Eℤuni002Cℤg1863 ℤg3398 ℤuni0031ℤg4669  is 
tantamount to picking an integer ℤg1870ℤuni0020 ℤg1488ℤuni0020ℤg2182 ℤg3041ℤg1499 and computing ℤg1855 ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1859ℤg3040ℤg1870ℤg3038ℤuni0020ℤg1865ℤg1867ℤg1856ℤuni0020ℤg1866). However, the 
decryption phase is more complex. If the input and output sizes are ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg4667 and ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667 bits 
respectively, the expansion is equal to ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤuni002Fℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg4667 . The value of expansion obtained in this 
approach is less than that achieved in GM. This mak es the scheme more attractive.  
Moreover, the encryption is not too expensive as we ll. The overhead in the decryption 
process is estimated to be ℤg1841ℤg4666ℤuni221Aℤg1863ℤuni002Eℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg4667ℤg4667 for pre-computation which remains constant for eac h 
dynamic decryption step. This implies that the valu e of k has to be taken very small, which 
in turn limits the gain obtained on the value of ex pansion. 
Naccache-Stern scheme: This scheme (Naccache & Stern, 1998) is an improvem ent of 
Benaloh’s scheme. Using a value of the parameter k that is greater than that used in the 
Benaloh’s scheme, it achieves a smaller expansion a nd thereby attains a superior efficiency. 
The encryption step is precisely the same as in Ben aloh’s scheme. However, decryption is 
different. The value of expansion is same as that i n Benaloh’s scheme, i.e., ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤuni002Fℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1863ℤg4667 . 
However, the cost of decryption is less and is give n by: ℤg1841ℤg4666ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤg2873ℤg1864ℤg1867ℤg1859ℤg4666ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤg4667 . The authors claim 
that it is possible to choose the values of the par ameters in the system in such a way that the 
achieved value of expansion is 4 (Naccache & Stern,  1998). 
Okamoto-Uchiyama scheme: To improve the performance of the earlier schemes o n 
homomorphic encryption, Okamoto and Uchiyama change d the base group G (Okamoto & 
Uchiyama, 1998). By taking ℤg1866 ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1868ℤg2870ℤg1869, p and q being two large prime numbers as usual, and 
the group ℤg2163 ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg2182ℤg3043ℤg3118ℤg1499, the authors achieve ℤg1863 ℤg3404 ℤg1868. The value of the expansion obtained in the 
scheme is 3. One of the biggest advantages of this scheme is that its security is equivalent to 
the factorization of n. However, a chosen-ciphertext attack has been prop osed on this 
scheme that can break the factorization problem. Th is has somewhat limited is applicability. 
However, this scheme was used to design the EPOC sy stems (Okamoto et al., 2000) which is 
accepted in the IEEE standard specifications for public-key cryptog raphy  (IEEE P1363).  
Paillier scheme: One of the most well-known  homomorphic encryption schemes is due to 
Paillier (Paillier, 1999). It is an improvement ove r the earlier schemes in the sense that it is 
able to decrease the value of expansion from 3 to 2 . The scheme uses ℤg1866 ℤg3404 ℤg1868ℤuni002Eℤg1869  
with ℤuni0020ℤuni0067ℤuni0063ℤuni0064ℤg3435ℤg1866ℤuni002Cℤg2038 ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667ℤg3439 ℤg3404 ℤuni0031. As usual p and q are two large primes. However, it considered the 
group ℤg2163 ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg2182ℤg3041ℤg3118ℤg1499 and a proper choice of H led to ℤg1863 ℤg3404 ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667. While the cost of encryption is not 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 11  
too high, decryption needs one exponentiation modul o ℤg1866ℤg2870 to the power ℤg2019ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667, and a 
multiplication modulo n. This makes decryption a bit heavyweight process. The author has 
shown how to manage decryption efficiently using th e famous Chinese Remainder Theorem . 
With smaller expansion and lower cost compared with  the other schemes, this scheme 
found great acceptance. In 2002, Cramer and Shoup p roposed a general approach to achieve 
higher security against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks  for certain cryptosystems with some 
particular algebraic properties (Cramer & Shoup, 20 02). They applied their propositions on 
Paillier’s original scheme and designed a stronger variant of homomorphic encryption. 
Bresson et al. proposed a slightly different versio n of a homomorphic encryption scheme 
that is more accurate for some applications (Bresso n et al., 2003).      
Damgard-Jurik scheme: Damgard and Jurik propose a generalization of Paill ier’s scheme to 
groups of the form ℤg2182ℤg3041ℤg3294ℤg3126ℤg3117ℤg1499 for ℤg1871 ℤg3408 ℤuni0030 (Damgard & Jurik, 2001). In this scheme, choice of  larger 
values of s will achieve lower values of expansion. This schem e can be used in a number of 
applications. For example, we can mention the adapt ation of the size of the plaintext, the use 
of threshold cryptography, electronic voting, and s o on. To encrypt a message, ℤg1865 ℤg1488 ℤg2182 ℤg3041ℤg1499, one 
picks at random ℤg1870ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2182 ℤg3041ℤg1499 and computes ℤg1859ℤg3040ℤg1870ℤg3041ℤg3294ℤg1488 ℤg2182ℤg3041ℤg3294ℤg3126ℤg3117. The authors show that if one can 
break the scheme for a given value ℤg1871 ℤg3404 ℤg2026, then one can break it for ℤg1871 ℤg3404 ℤg2026 ℤg3398 ℤuni0031 . They also 
show that the semantic security of this scheme is e quivalent to that of Paillier’s scheme. The 
value of expansion can be computed using: ℤuni0031 ℤg3397 ℤuni0031ℤuni002Fℤg1871. It is clear that expansion can attain a 
value close to 1 if s is sufficiently large. The ratio of the cost for e ncryption in this scheme 
over Paillier’s scheme can be estimated to be: ℤg3046ℤg4666ℤg3046ℤg2878ℤg2869ℤg4667ℤg4666ℤg3046ℤg2878ℤg2870ℤg4667
ℤg2874. The same ratio for the decryption 
process will have value equal to: ℤg4666ℤg3046ℤg2878ℤg2869ℤg4667ℤg4666ℤg3046ℤg2878ℤg2870ℤg4667
ℤg2874. Even if this scheme has a lower value of 
expansion as compared to Paillier’s scheme, it is c omputationally more intensive. Moreover, 
if we want to encrypt or decrypt k blocks of ℤg1864ℤg4666ℤg1866ℤg4667 bits, running Paillier’s scheme k times is less 
expensive than running Damgard-Jurik‘s scheme.  
Galbraith scheme: This is an adaptation of the existing homomorphic e ncryption schemes 
in the context of elliptic curves (Galbraith, 2002) . Its expansion is equal to 3. For ℤg1871 ℤg3404 ℤuni0031, the 
ratio of the encryption cost for this scheme over t hat of Paillier’s scheme can be estimated to 
be about 7, while the same ratio for the cost of de cryption cost is about 14 for the same value 
of s. However, the most important advantage of this sch eme is that the cost of encryption 
and decryption can be decreased using larger values  of s. In addition, the security of the 
scheme increases with the increase in the value of s as it is the case in Damgard-Jurik’s 
scheme.  
Castagnos scheme: Castagnos explored the possibility of improving the  performance of 
homomorphic encryption schemes using quadratic fiel ds quotations (Castagnos, 2006; 
Castagnos, 2007). This scheme achieves an expansion  value of 3 and the ratio of 
encryption/decryption cost with ℤg1871 ℤg3404 ℤuni0031 over Paillier’s scheme can be estimated to be abou t 2.   
5. Applications and Properties of Homomorphic Encry ption Schemes 
An inherent drawback of homomorphic cryptosystems i s that attacks on these systems 
might possibly exploit their additional structural information. For instance, using plain RSA 
(Rivest et al., 1978b) for signing, the multiplicati on of two signatures yields a valid signature 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies 
12  
of the product of the two corresponding messages. A lthough there are many ways to avoid 
such attacks, for instance, by application of hash functions, the use of redundancy or 
probabilistic schemes, this potential weakness lead s us to the question why homomorphic 
schemes should be used instead of conventional cryp tosystems under certain situations. The 
main reason for the interest in homomorphic cryptos ystems is its wide application scope. 
There are theoretical as well as practical applicat ions in different areas of cryptography. In 
the following, we list some of the main application s and properties of homomorphic 
schemes and summarize the idea behind them.  
5.1 Some Applications of Homomorphic Encryption Sch emes 
Protection of mobile agents:  One of the most interesting applications of homomo rphic 
encryption is its use in protection of mobile agent s. As we have seen in Section 3, a 
homomorphic encryption scheme on a special non-abel ian group would lead to an 
algebraically homomorphic cryptosystem on the finit e filed F2. Since all conventional 
computer architectures are based on binary strings and only require multiplication and 
addition, such homomorphic cryptosystems would offe r the possibility to encrypt a whole 
program so that it is still executable. Hence, it c ould be used to protect mobile agents against 
malicious hosts by encrypting them (Sander & Tschud in, 1998a). The protection of mobile 
agents by homomorphic encryption can be used in two  ways: (i) computing with  encrypted 
functions  and (ii) computing with encrypted data . Computation with encrypted functions is a 
special case of protection of mobile agents. In suc h scenarios, a secret function is publicly 
evaluated in such a way that the function remains s ecret. Using homomorphic 
cryptosystems the encrypted function can be evaluat ed which guarantees its privacy. 
Homomorphic schemes also work on encrypted data to compute publicly while maintaining 
the privacy of the secret data. This can be done en crypting the data in advance and then 
exploiting the homomorphic property to compute with  encrypted data.  
Multiparty computation: In multiparty computation schemes, several parties are interested 
in computing a common, public function on their inp uts while keeping their individual 
inputs private. This problem belongs to the area of  computing with encrypted data . Usually in 
multiparty computation protocols, we have a set of ℤg1866 ℤg3410 ℤuni0032 players whereas in computing 
with encrypted data scenarios ℤuni0020ℤg1866 ℤg3404 ℤuni0032. Furthermore, in multi-party computation protocols , 
the function that should be computed is publicly kn own, whereas in the area of computing 
with encrypted data it is a private input of one pa rty.  
Secret sharing scheme: In secret sharing schemes, parties share a secret s o that no 
individual party can reconstruct the secret form th e information available to it. However, if 
some parties cooperate with each other, they may be  able to reconstruct the secret. In this 
scenario, the homomorphic property implies that the  composition of the shares of the secret 
is equivalent to the shares of the composition of t he secrets.    
Threshold schemes: Both secret sharing schemes and the multiparty comp utation schemes 
are examples of threshold schemes. Threshold scheme s can be implemented using 
homomorphic encryption techniques.  
Zero-knowledge proofs: This is a fundamental primitive of cryptographic pr otocols and 
serves as an example of a theoretical application o f homomorphic cryptosystems. Zero-
knowledge proofs are used to prove knowledge of som e private information. For instance, 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 13  
consider the  case where a user has to prove his identity to a ho st by logging in with her 
account and private password. Obviously, in such a protocol the user wants her private 
information (i.e., her password) to stay private an d not to be leaked during the protocol 
operation. Zero-knowledge proofs guarantee that the  protocol communicates exactly the 
knowledge that was intended, and no (zero) extra kn owledge. Examples of zero-knowledge 
proofs using homomorphic property can be found in ( Cramer & Damgard, 1998).   
Election schemes: In election schemes, the homomorphic property provi des a tool to obtain 
the tally given the encrypted votes without decrypt ing the individual votes.  
Watermarking and fingerprinting schemes:  Digital watermarking and fingerprinting 
schemes embed additional information into digital d ata. The homomorphic property is used 
to add a mark to previously encrypted data. In gene ral, watermarks are used to identify the 
owner/seller of digital goods to ensure the copyrig ht. In fingerprinting schemes, the person 
who buys the data should be identifiable by the mer chant to ensure that data is not illegally 
redistributed. Further properties of such schemes c an be found in (Pfitzmann & Waidner, 
1997; Adelsbach et al. 2002).  
Oblivious transfer:  It is an interesting cryptographic primitive. Usua lly in a two-party 1-
out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol, the first par ty sends a bit to the second party in such as 
way that the second party receives it with probabil ity ½, without the first party knowing 
whether or not the second party received the bit. A n example of such a protocol that uses 
the homomorphic property can be found in (Lipmaa, 2 003). 
Commitment schemes: Commitment schemes are some fundamental cryptograph ic 
primitives. In a commitment scheme, a player makes a commitment. She is able to choose a 
value from some set and commit to her choice such t hat she can no longer change her mind. 
She does not have to reveal her choice although she  may do so at some point later. Some 
commitment schemes can be efficiently implemented u sing homomorphic property.    
Lottery protocols: Usually in a cryptographic lottery, a number pointi ng to the winning 
ticket has to be jointly and randomly chosen by all  participants. Using a homomorphic 
encryption scheme this can be realized as follows: Each player chooses a random number 
which she encrypts. Then using the homomorphic prop erty the encryption of the sum of the 
random values can be efficiently computed. The comb ination of this and a threshold 
decryption scheme  leads to the desired functionality. More details a bout homomorphic 
properties of lottery schemes can be found in (Fouq ue et al., 2000).  
Mix-nets: Mix-nets are protocols that provide anonymity for s enders by collecting 
encrypted messages from several users. For instance , one can consider mix-nets that collect 
ciphertexts and output the corresponding plaintexts  in a randomly permuted order. In such 
a scenario, privacy is achieved by requiring that t he permutation that matches inputs to 
outputs is kept secret to anyone except the mix-net . In particular, determining a correct 
input/output pair, i.e., a ciphertext with correspo nding plaintext, should not be more 
effective then guessing one at random. A desirable property to build such mix-nets is re-
encryption which is achieved by using homomorphic e ncryption. More information about 
applications of homomorphic encryption in mix-nets can be found in (Golle et al., 2004; 
Damgard & Jurik, 2003).

Data aggregation in wireless sensor networks: In-network data aggregation in WSNs is a 
technique that combines partial results at the inte rmediate nodes en route to the base station 
(i.e., the node issuing the query), thereby reducin g the communication overhead and 
optimizing the bandwidth utilization in the wireles s links (Sen 2012a; Sen & Maitra, 2011;). 
However, this technique raises privacy and security  issues if the sensor nodes which need to 
share their data with the aggregator node. In appli cations such as healthcare and military 
surveillance where the sensitivity of private data of the sensor is very high, the aggregation 
has to be carried out in a privacy-preserving way, so that the sensitive data are not revealed 
to the aggregator. Secure and efficient schemes for  additive data aggregation functions have 
been proposed in (Sen 2012a; Sen & Maitra 2011; He et al., 2007). However, these schemes 
are not generic and cannot be applied for multiplic ative aggregation function. 
Homomorphic encryption schemes can be applied to pr otect privacy of input data while 
computing an arbitrary aggregation function in a wi reless sensor network. Security in 
sensor networks is a well researched problem (Sen 2 012b; Sen & Ukil, 2010; Sen, 2010a; Sen 
2010b; Sen, 2009). Security in data aggregation has  also been studied extensively by 
researchers. Interested readers may refer to (Sen, 2012a; Sen 2011a) for further details.  
 
5.2 Some Properties of Homomorphic Encryption Schem es 
Homomorphic encryption schemes have some interestin g mathematical properties. In the 
following, we mention some of these properties. 
Re-randomizable encryption/re-encryption:  Re-randomizable cryptosystems (Groth, 2004) 
are probabilistic cryptosystems with the additional  property that given the public key ℤg1863ℤg3032 
and an encryption ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4667 of a message ℤg1865 ℤg1488 ℤg2169ℤuni0020under the public key ℤg1863ℤg3032 and a random 
number ℤg1870ℤuni0020 ℤg1488 ℤg2182 it is possible to efficiently convert ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4667 into another encryption ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4593ℤg4667 
that is perfectly indistinguishable from a fresh  encryption of m under the public key ℤg1863ℤg3032. This 
property is also called re-encryption .  
It obvious that every probabilistic homomorphic cry ptosystem is re-randomizable. Without 
loss of generality, we assume that the cryptosystem  is additively homomorphic. Given 
ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4667  and the public key ℤg1863ℤg3032, we can compute ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤuni0030ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4593ℤg4593 ℤg4667 for a random number r’’ and 
hence compute the following: 
ℤg1827ℤg1856ℤg1856ℤg4672ℤg1831 ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4667ℤuni002Cℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤuni0030ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4593ℤg4593 ℤg4667ℤg4673 ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1831 ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865 ℤg3397 ℤuni0030ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4593ℤg4667ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1831ℤg3038ℤg3280ℤg4666ℤg1865ℤuni002Cℤg1870ℤg4593) 
where r’ is an appropriate random number. We note that this  is exactly what a blinding 
algorithm  does.  
Random self-reducibility:  Along with the possibility of re-encryption comes the property of 
random self-reducibility concerning the problem of computing the plaintext from the 
ciphertext. A cryptosystem is called random self-reducible  if any algorithm that can break a 
non-trivial fraction of ciphertexts can also break a random instance with significant 
probability. This property is discussed in detail i n (Damgard et al., 2010; Sander et al., 1999). 
Verifiable encryptions / fair encryptions:  If an encryption is verifiable, it provides a 
mechanism to check the correctness of encrypted dat a without compromising on the secrecy 
of the data. For instance, this is useful in voting  schemes to convince any observer that the 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 15  
encrypted name of a candidate, i.e., the encrypted vote is indeed in the list of candidates. A 
cryptosystem with this property that is based on ho momorphic encryption can be found in 
(Poupard & Stern, 2000). Verifiable encryptions are  also called fair encryptions .  
6. Fully Homomorphic Encryption Schemes 
In 2009, Gentry described the first plausible const ruction of a fully homomorphic 
cryptosystem that supports both addition and multip lication (Gentry, 2009). Gentry’s 
proposed fully homomorphic encryption consists of s everal steps: First, it constructs a 
somewhat homomorphic  scheme that supports evaluating low-degree polynom ials on the 
encrypted data. Next, it squashes  the decryption procedure so that it can be express ed as a 
low-degree polynomial which is supported by the sch eme, and finally, it applies a 
bootstrapping transformation  to obtain a fully homomorphic scheme. The essentia l approach 
of this scheme is to derive and establish a process  that can evaluate polynomials of high-
enough degree using a decryption procedure that can  be expressed as a polynomial of low-
enough degree. Once the degree of polynomials that can be evaluated by the scheme 
exceeds the degree of the decryption polynomial by a factor of two, the scheme is called 
bootstrappable  and it can then be converted into a fully homomorp hic scheme.  
For designing a bootstrappable scheme, Gentry prese nted a somewhat homomorphic 
scheme (Gentry, 2009) which is roughly a GGH (Goldr eich, Goldwasser, Halevi)-type 
scheme (Goldreich et al., 1997; Micciancio, 2001) o ver ideal lattices. Gentry later proved that 
with an appropriate key-generation procedure, the s ecurity of that scheme can be reduced to 
the worst-case hardness of some lattice problems in  ideal lattice constructions (Gentry, 
2010). Since this somewhat homomorphic scheme is no t bootstrappable, Gentry described a 
transformation to squash the decryption procedure, reducing the degree of the decryption 
polynomial (Gentry, 2009). This is done by adding t o the public key, an additional hint 
about the secret key in the form of a sparse subset-sum problem  (SSSP). The public key is 
augmented with a big set of vectors in such a way t hat there exists a very sparse subset of 
them that adds up to the secret key. A ciphertext o f the underlying scheme can be post-
processed  using this additional hint and the post-processed ciphertext can be decrypted with 
a low-degree polynomial, thereby achieving a bootst rappable scheme.  
Gentry’s construction is quite involved – the secre t key, even in the private key version of 
his scheme is a short basis of a random ideal lattice . Generating pairs of public and secret 
bases with the right distributions appropriate for the worst-case to average-case reduction is 
technically quite complicated. A significant resear ch effort has been devoted to increase the 
efficiency of its implementation (Gentry & Halevi, 2011; Smart & Vercauteren, 2010).  
A parallel line of work that utilizes ideal lattice s in cryptography dates back to the NTRU 
cryptosystem (Hoffstein et al., 1998). This approac h uses ideal lattices for efficient 
cryptographic constructions. The additional structu re of ideal lattices, compared to ordinary 
lattices, makes their representation more powerful and enables faster computation. 
Motivated by the work of Micciancio (Micciancio, 20 07), a significant number of work 
(Peikert & Rosen, 2006; Lyubashevsky & Micciancio, 2 006; Peikert & Rosen, 2007; 
Lyubashevsky et al., 2008; Lybashevsky & Micciancio , 2008) has produced efficient 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies 
16  
constructions of various cryptographic primitives w hose security can formally be reduced to 
the hardness of short-vector problems in ideal latt ices (Brakerski & Vaikuntanathan, 2011).  
Lyubashevsky et al. (Lyubashevsky et al., 2010) pre sent the ring learning with errors  (RLWE) 
assumption which is the ring counterpart  of Regev’s learning with errors assumption (Regev, 
2005). In a nutshell, the assumption is that given polynomially many samples over a certain 
ring of the form ( ℤg1853ℤg3036ℤuni002Cℤg1853ℤg3036ℤg1871 ℤg3397 ℤg1857ℤg3036ℤg4667, where s is a random secret ring element , ai’s are distributed 
uniformly randomly in the ring, and ei are small ring elements, it will be impossible for an 
adversary to distinguish this sequence of samples f rom random pairs of ring elements. The 
authors have shown that this simple assumption can be very efficiently reduced to the worst 
case hardness of short-vector problems on ideal lat tices. They have also shown how to 
construct a very efficient ring counterpart to Regev ’s public-key encryption scheme (Regev, 
2005), as well as a counterpart to the identity-bas ed encryption scheme presented in (Gentry 
et al., 2008) by using the basis sampling technique s in (Regev, 2005). The scheme presented 
in (Lyubashevsky et al., 2010) is very elegant and efficient since it is not dependent on any 
complex computations over ideal lattices.  
Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan raised a natural quest ion that whether the above approaches 
(i.e., ideal lattices and RLWE) can be effectively e xploited so that benefits of both these 
approaches can be achieved at the same time – namel y the functional powerfulness on the 
one hand (i.e., the ideal lattice approach) and the  simplicity and efficiency of the other (i.e., 
RLWE). They have shown that indeed this can be done (Brakerski & Vaikuntanathan, 2011). 
They have constructed a somewhat homomorphic encryp tion scheme based on RLWE. The 
scheme inherits the simplicity and efficiency, as w ell as the worst case relation to ideal 
lattices. Moreover, the scheme enjoys key dependent message security  (KDM security, also 
known as circular security ), since it can securely encrypt polynomial functio ns (over an 
appropriately defined ring) of its own secret key. The significance of this feature of the 
scheme in context of homomorphic encryption has bee n clearly explained by the authors. 
The authors argue that all known constructions of f ully homomorphic encryption employ a 
bootstrapping technique that enforces the public ke y of the scheme to grow linearly with the 
maximal depth of evaluated circuits. This is a majo r drawback with regard to the usability 
and the efficiency of the schemes. However, the siz e of the public key can be made 
independent of the circuit depth if the somewhat ho momorphic scheme can securely 
encrypt its own secret key. With the design of this  scheme, the authors have solved an open 
problem - achieving circular secure somewhat homomorphic encryption. They have also 
computed the circular security of their scheme with  respect to the representation of the 
secret key as a ring element, where bootstrapping r equires circular security with respect to 
the bitwise representation of the secret key (actua lly, the bitwise representation of the 
squashed  secret key). Since there is no prior work that stu dies a possible co-existence between 
somewhat homomorphism with any form of circular sec urity, the work is a significant first 
step towards removing the assumption (Brakerski & V aikuntanathan, 2011). The authors 
have also shown how to transform the proposed schem e into a fully homomorphic 
encryption scheme following Gentry’s blueprint of squashing  and bootstrapping . Applying the 
techniques presented in (Brakerski & Vaikuntanathan , 2011a), the authors argue that 
squashing  can even be avoided at the cost of relying of a sparse  version of RLWE that is not 
known to reduce to worst case scenarios. This great ly enhances the efficiency of the 
proposed scheme in practical applications. The prop osed scheme is also additively key-

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 17  
homomorphic – a property that has found applications in achievi ng security against key-related 
attacks  (Applebaum et al., 2011).  
Smart and Vercauteren (Smart & Vercauteren, 2010) p resent a fully homomorphic 
encryption scheme has smaller key and ciphertext si zes. The construction proposed by the 
authors follows the fully homomorphic construction based on ideal lattices proposed by 
Gentry (Gentry, 2009). It produces a fully homomorp hic scheme form a somewhat 
homomorphic scheme . For somewhat homomorphic scheme, the public and t he private keys 
consist of two large integers (one of which shared by both the public and the private key), 
and the ciphertext consists of one large integer. T he scheme (Smart & Vercauteren, 2010) has 
smaller ciphertext blow up  and reduced key size than in Gentry’s scheme based  on ideal 
lattices. Moreover, the scheme also allows efficien t fully homomorphic encryption over any 
field of characteristics two. More specifically, it  uses arithmetic of cyclotomic number fields . In 
particular, the authors have focused on the field g enerated by the polynomial: ℤuni0020ℤg1832ℤg4666ℤg1850ℤg4667ℤg3404ℤuni0020ℤg1850ℤg2870ℤg3289ℤg3397
ℤuni0020ℤuni0031. However, they also noted that the scheme could be  applied with arbitrary (even non-
cyclotomic) number fields as well. In spite of havi ng a large number of advantages, the 
major problem with this scheme is that the key gene ration method is very slow. 
Gentry and Halevi presented a novel implementation approach for the variant of Smart and 
Vercauteren proposition (Smart & Vercauteren, 2010) , which had a greatly improved key 
generation phase (Gentry & Halevi, 2011). In partic ular, the authors have noted that key 
generation (for cyclotomic fields) is essentially a n application of a Discrete Fourier Transform  
(DFT), followed by a small quantum of computation, and then application of the inverse 
transform. The authors then further demonstrate tha t it is not even required to perform the 
DFTs if one selects the cyclotomic field to be of t he form:  ℤg1850ℤg2870ℤg3289ℤg3397 ℤuni0020ℤuni0031. The authors illustrate this 
by using a recursive approach to deduce two constan ts from the secret key which 
subsequently facilitates the key generation algorit hm to construct a valid associated public 
key. The key generation method of Gentry and Halevi  (Gentry & Halevi, 2011) is fast. 
However, the scheme appears particularly tailored t o work with two-power roots of unity.  
Researchers have also examined ways of improving key  generation in fully homomorphic 
encryption schemes. For example, in (Ogura et al., 2010) a method is proposed for 
construction of keys for essentially random number fields by pulling random elements and 
analyzing eigenvalues  of the corresponding matrices. However, this metho d is unable to 
achieve the improvement in efficiency in terms of reduced ciphertext blow up  as done in 
(Smart & Vercauteren, 2010) and (Gentry & Halevi, 2 011).  
Stehle and Steinfield improved Gentry’s fully homom orphic scheme and obtained a faster 
fully homomorphic scheme with O(n3.5 ) bits complexity per elementary binary 
addition/multiplication gate (Stehle & Steinfeld, 2 010). However, the hardness assumption 
of the security of the scheme is stronger than that  of Gentry’s scheme (Gentry, 2009). The 
improved complexity of the proposed scheme stems fr om two sources. First, the authors 
have given a more aggressive security analysis of t he sparse subset sum problem  (SSSP) against 
lattice attacks as compared to the analysis present ed in (Gentry, 2009). The SSSP along with 
the ideal lattice bounded distance decoding  (BDD) problem are the two problems underlying 
the security of Gentry’s fully homomorphic scheme. In his security analysis of BDD, Gentry 
has used the best known complexity bound for the ap proximate shortest vector problem  (SVP) 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies 
18  
in lattices. However, in analyzing SSSP, Gentry has  assumed the availability of an exact SVP 
oracle. On the contrary, the finer analysis of Steh le and Steinfield for SSSP takes into account 
the complexity of approximate SVP, thereby making i t more consistent with the assumption 
underlying the analysis of the BDD problem. This le ads to choices of smaller parameter in 
the scheme. Moreover, Stehle and Steinfield have re laxed the definition of fully 
homomorphic encryption to allow for a negligible bu t non-zero probability of decryption 
error. They have shown that the randomness in the SplitKey  key generation for the squashed 
decryption algorithm  (i.e., the decryption algorithms of the bootstrapp able scheme) in the 
Gentry’s scheme can be gainfully exploited to allow  a negligible decryption error 
probability. This decryption error, although neglig ible in value, can lead to rounding 
precision used in representing the ciphertext compo nents that is almost half the value of the 
precision as achieved in Gentry’s scheme (Gentry, 2 009), which involves zero error 
probability.  
In (Chunsheng, 2012), Chunsheng proposed a modifica tion of the fully homomorphic 
encryption scheme of Smart and Vercauteren (Smart &  Vercauteren, 2010). The author has 
applied a self-loop bootstrappable technique  so that the security of the modified scheme only 
depends on the hardness of the polynomial coset problem  and does not require any 
assumption of the sparse subset problem  as required in the original work of Smart and 
Vercauteren (Smart & Vercauteren, 2010). In additio n, the author have constructed a non-
self-loop fully homomorphic encryption scheme  that uses cycle keys . In a nutshell, the security of 
the improved fully homomorphic encryption scheme in  this work is based on use of three 
mathematical approaches: (i) hardness of factoring integer problem, (ii) solving Diophantine 
equation problem, and (iii) finding approximate gre atest common divisor problem.  
Boneh and Freeman propose a linearly homomorphic si gnature scheme that authenticates 
vector subspaces of a given ambient space (Boneh & Freeman, 2011). The scheme has several 
novel features that were not present in any of the existing similar schemes. First, the scheme 
is the first of its kind that enables authentication of vectors over binary fields ; previous schemes 
could not authenticate vectors with large or growin g coefficients. Second, the scheme is the 
only scheme that is based on the problem of finding short vectors in integer lattice s , and 
therefore, it enjoys the worst-case security guaran tee that is common to lattice-based 
cryptosystems . The scheme can be used to authenticate linear tra nsformations of signed data, 
such as those arising when computing mean and Fouri er transform or in networks that use 
network coding  (Boneh & Freeman, 2011). The work has three major contributions in the state 
of the art as identified by the authors: (i) Homomorphic signatures over F2: the authors have 
constructed the first unforgeable linearly homomorphic signature scheme  that authenticates 
vectors with coordinates in F2. It is an example of a cryptographic primitive tha t can be built 
using lattice models, but cannot be built using bil inear maps or other traditional algebraic 
methods based on factoring or discrete log type pro blems. The scheme can be modified to 
authenticate vectors with coefficients in other sma ll fields, including prime fields and 
extension fields such as ℤg1780ℤg2779ℤg1804. Moreover, the scheme is private, in the sense tha t a derived 
signature on a vector v leaks no information about the original signed vec tors beyond what 
is revealed by v. (ii) A simple k-time signature without random oracles:  the authors have 
presented a stateless signature scheme and have pro ved that it is secure in the standard 
model when used to sign at most k messages, for small values of k. The public key of the 
scheme is significantly smaller than that of any ot her stateless lattice-based signature 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 19  
scheme that can sign multiple large messages and is  secure in the standard model. The 
construction proposed by the authors can be viewed as removing the random oracle  from the 
signature scheme of Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntana than (Gentry et al., 2008), but only for 
signing k messages (Boneh & Freeman, 2011). (iii) New tools for lattice-based signatures:  the 
scheme is unforgeable based on a new hard problem o n lattices, which the authors have 
called the k-small integer solutions  (k-SIS) problem. The authors have shown that k-SIS 
reduces to the small integer solution  (SIS) problem, which is known to be as hard as sta ndard 
worst-case lattice problems (Micciancio & Regev, 200 7).    
7. Conclusion and Future Trends 
The study of fully homomorphic encryption has led t o a number of new and exciting 
concepts and questions, as well as a powerful tool- kit to address them. We conclude the 
chapter by discussing a number of research directio ns related to the domain of fully 
homomorphic encryption and more generally, on the p roblem of computing on encrypted 
data.  
Applications of fully homomorphic encryption:  While Gentry’s original construction was 
considered as being infeasible for practical deploy ments, recent constructions and 
implementation efforts have drastically improved th e efficiency of fully homomorphic 
encryption (Vaikuntanathan, 2011). The initial impl ementation efforts focused on Gentry’s 
original scheme and its variants (Smart & Vercauter en, 2010; Smart & Vercauteren, 2012; 
Coron et al., 2011; Gentry & Halevi, 2011), which s eemed to pose rather inherent efficiency 
bottlenecks. Later implementations leverage the rec ent algorithmic advances (Brakerski & 
Vaikuntanathan, 2011; Brakerski et al., 2011; Brake rski & Vaikuntanathan, 2011a) that result 
in asymptotically better fully homomorphic encrypti on systems, as well as new algebraic 
mechanisms to improve the overall efficiency of the se schemes ( Naehrig et al., 2011; Gentry 
et al., 2012; Smart & Vercauteren, 2012). 
Non-malleability and homomorphic encryption:  Homomorphism and non-malleability  are 
two orthogonal properties of an encryption scheme. Homomorphic encryption schemes 
permit anyone to transform an encryption of a messa ge m into an encryption of f(m)  for non-
trivial functions f. Non-malleable encryption, on the other hand, prev ents precisely this sort 
of thing- it requires that no adversary be able to transform an encryption of m into an 
encryption of any related  message. Essentially, what we need is a combinatio n of both the 
properties that selectively permit homomorphic computations  (Vaikuntanathan, 2011). This 
implies that the evaluator should be able to homomo rphically compute any function from 
some pre-specified class Fhom ; however, she should not be able to transform an e ncryption of 
m into an encryption of f(m)  for which ℤg1858 ℤg1488ℤuni0020ℤg2162 ℤg3035ℤg3042ℤg3040   does not hold good (i.e., f does not belong 
to Fhom ). The natural question that arises is: whether we can control what is being 
(homomorphically) computed ?  
Answering this question turns out to be tricky. Bon eh, Segev and Waters (Boneh et al., 2011) 
propose the notion of targeted malleability  – a possible formalization of such a requirement a s 
well as formal constructions of such encryption sch emes. Their encryption scheme is based 
on a strong knowledge of exponent-type  assumption that allows iterative evaluation of at most 
t functions, where t is a suitably determined and pre-specified constan t. Improving their 

Theory and Practice of Cryptography and Network Sec urity Protocols and Technologies 
20  
construction as well as the underlying complexity a ssumptions is an important open 
problem (Vaikuntanathan, 2011). 
It is also interesting to extend the definition of non-malleability to allow for chosen cipher-text 
attacks . As an example, we consider the problem that invol ves implementing an encrypted 
targeted advertisement system that generates advert isements depending on the contents of a user’s e-
mail. Since the e-mail is stored in an encrypted form w ith the user’s public key, the e-mail 
server performs a homomorphic evaluation and comput es an encrypted advertisement to be 
sent back to the user. The user decrypts it, perfor ms an action depending on what she sees. 
If the advertisement is relevant, she might choose to click on it; otherwise, she simply 
discards it. However, if the e-mail server is aware  to this information, namely whether the 
user clicked on the advertisement or not, it can us e this as a restricted decryption oracle  to 
break the security of the user’s encryption scheme and possibly even recover her secret key. 
Such attacks are ubiquitous whenever we compute on encrypted data, almost to the point 
that CCA security seems inevitable. Yet, it is easy  to see that chosen ciphertext (CCA2-
secure) homomorphic encryption schemes cannot exist . Therefore, an appropriate security 
definition and constructions that achieve the defin ition is in demand.  
Fully homomorphic encryption and functional decrypt ion: Homomorphic encryption 
schemes permit anyone to evaluate functions on encr ypted data, but the evaluators never 
see any information about the result. It is possibl e to construct an encryption scheme where 
a user can compute f(m)  from an encryption of a message m, but she should not be able to 
learn any other information about m (including the intermediate results in the computa tion 
of f)? Essentially, the issue boils down to the followi ng question: can we control the 
information that the evaluator can see?  Such an encryption scheme is called a functional 
encryption scheme. The concept of functional encryption scheme was fir st introduced by Sahai 
and Waters (Sahai & Waters, 2005) and subsequently investigated in a number of intriguing 
works (Katz et al., 2013; Lewko et al., 2010; Boneh  et al., 2011; Agrawal et al., 2011). 
Although the constructions in these propositions wo rk for several interesting families of 
functions (such as monotone formulas and inner prod ucts), construction of a fully functional 
encryption scheme is still not achieved and remains  as an open problem. What we need is a 
novel and generic encryption system that provides u s with fine-grained control over what 
one can see and access and what one can compute on data to get a desired output.  
Other problems and applications:  Another important open question relates to the 
assumptions underlying the current fully homomorphi c encryption systems. All known 
fully homomorphic encryption schemes are based on hardness of lattice problems . The natural 
question that arises - can we construct fully homom orphic from other approaches – say, for 
example, from number-theoretic assumptions? Can we bring in the issue of the hardness of 
factoring or discrete logarithms in this problem? 
In addition to the scenarios where it is beneficial  to keep all data encrypted and to perform 
computations on encrypted data, fully homomorphic e ncryption can be gainfully exploited 
to solve a number of practical problems in cryptogr aphy. Two such examples are the 
problems of verifiably outsourcing computation  (Goldwasser et al., 2008; Gennaro et al., 2010; 
Chung et al., 2010; Applebaum et al., 2010) and constructing short non-interactive zero-
knowledge proofs  (Gentry, 2009). Some of the applications of fully homomorphic encryption 
do not require its full power. For example, in private information retrieval  (PIR), it is sufficient 

 
Homomorphic Encryption: Theory and Application 21  
to have a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme th at is capable of evaluating simple 
database indexing functions. For this applications,  what is needed is an optimized and less 
functional encryption scheme that is more efficient  than a fully homomorphic encryption 
function. Design of such functions for different ap plication scenarios is also a current hot 
topic of research.
