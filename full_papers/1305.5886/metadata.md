## Translation Notes

This is a comprehensive survey paper on homomorphic encryption covering:
- Cryptographic fundamentals
- Theoretical foundations of homomorphic encryption
- Classical schemes (RSA, ElGamal, Paillier, etc.)
- Fully homomorphic encryption (Gentry's breakthrough)
- Applications in cloud computing, secure voting, privacy-preserving computations
- Mathematical proofs and security properties

**Special Considerations:**
- Contains extensive mathematical notation and proofs
- Requires careful translation of cryptographic terminology
- Must preserve LaTeX equations and add Arabic explanations
- Key terms: homomorphism, lattice-based cryptography, bootstrapping, noise management
