## Translation Summary

Successfully completed full translation of this landmark 1966 paper by Peter J. Landin. The paper introduced ISWIM (If you See What I Mean), an abstract programming language that fundamentally connected programming languages with lambda calculus and formal semantics.

**Key Achievements:**
- All 11 main sections plus abstract fully translated
- Technical accuracy maintained throughout (all sections ≥0.85)
- Mathematical notation and formal rules preserved
- Historical context and significance captured
- Glossary consistency maintained

**Special Handling:**
- Lambda calculus notation and equivalence rules (β-reduction, etc.) preserved
- ISWIM syntax examples maintained in both languages
- Formal structure definitions translated with precision
- Comparison with LISP and ALGOL 60 preserved
- Church-Rosser theorem and combinatory logic references maintained

**Impact:**
This translation makes accessible to Arabic speakers one of the most influential papers in programming language design, which laid the foundation for:
- Modern functional programming languages (ML, Haskell, etc.)
- Formal semantics of programming languages
- Understanding of language design as language families
- Connection between syntax and semantics through abstraction levels
