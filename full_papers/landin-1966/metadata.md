## Historical Significance

This paper is one of the most influential in programming language history:
- Introduced ISWIM, a foundational abstract programming language
- Bridged lambda calculus and practical programming languages
- Influenced development of functional languages (ML, Haskell, Scheme)
- Introduced the concept of "syntactic sugar" and desugaring
- Established semantic foundations for language design
- The title's playful reference suggests programming languages share common semantics
