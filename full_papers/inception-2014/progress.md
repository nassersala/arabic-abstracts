## Summary

All 10 sections of the GoogLeNet/Inception paper have been successfully translated from English to Arabic with high quality scores (all ≥ 0.85). The translation maintains technical accuracy while ensuring readability in formal academic Arabic.

### Key Achievements:
- Consistent use of technical glossary terms
- Preservation of all mathematical equations and notations
- Proper handling of citations and references
- Maintained figure and table references
- All section scores meet or exceed the minimum quality threshold of 0.85

### Translation Approach:
- Formal academic Arabic style throughout
- English technical terms preserved where standard (e.g., dropout, softmax, R-CNN)
- Proper nouns maintained (GoogLeNet, Inception, ImageNet, ILSVRC)
- Mathematical expressions and dimensions kept unchanged
- Clear Arabic equivalents provided for key concepts
