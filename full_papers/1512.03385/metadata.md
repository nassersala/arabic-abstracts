## Paper Significance

ResNet is one of the most influential papers in deep learning and computer vision:
- **Citations:** 100,000+ (one of the most cited AI papers)
- **Impact:** Revolutionized deep learning by enabling training of very deep networks (100+ layers)
- **Innovation:** Introduced residual connections (skip connections) that solved the degradation problem
- **Results:** Won ILSVRC 2015 classification competition with 3.57% error on ImageNet
- **Applications:** Foundation for modern computer vision architectures

## Translation Priority

**Tier:** 1B - Deep Learning Foundations
**Rationale:** Essential paper that CS students studying deep learning must read. Residual connections are now fundamental building blocks in modern neural architectures.
