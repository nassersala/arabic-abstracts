## Paper Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in adversarial machine learning and neural network security. The Carlini & Wagner (C&W) attack has become the gold standard for evaluating adversarial robustness. The paper:

- Introduced three powerful attack algorithms (L₀, L₂, L∞)
- Demonstrated that defensive distillation provides minimal actual security
- Established evaluation methodologies still used today
- Achieved 100% attack success rates on all tested datasets
- Introduced the concept of high-confidence adversarial examples for transferability testing

**Citation Count:** Highly cited (thousands of citations)
**Impact:** Foundational work in adversarial ML security
