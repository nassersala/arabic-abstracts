## Translation Notes

This is a comprehensive 74-page paper with extensive technical content, including:
- Mathematical equations and algorithms
- Code examples and pseudocode
- Performance benchmarks and tables
- Detailed experimental results
- Large-scale model architecture descriptions

Special attention needed for:
- Consistent translation of technical terms (competitive programming, transformer, sampling, filtering, clustering)
- Preservation of mathematical notation
- Code snippets remain in English with Arabic descriptions
- Table and figure captions in both languages
