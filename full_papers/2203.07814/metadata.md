## Paper Overview

This paper presents AlphaCode, a system capable of generating novel solutions to challenging programming problems at a competitive level. The system achieved a top 54.3% ranking in programming competitions with over 5,000 participants on Codeforces.

**Key Contributions:**
1. Extensive and clean competitive programming dataset for training and evaluation
2. Large and efficient-to-sample transformer-based architectures
3. Large-scale model sampling to explore the search space, followed by filtering based on program behavior

**Significance:** This work represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted programming and code generation, demonstrating that large language models can tackle complex algorithmic reasoning tasks that go beyond simple code translation.
