## Paper Overview

This paper proposes a conceptual framework called "Digital Accessibility Literacy" (DAL) as a comprehensive approach to teaching and learning digital accessibility. The framework is built on the dual concepts of encoding (creating accessible content) and decoding (understanding and using accessible content), drawing from literacy theory in education.

**Key Contributions:**
- Introduces Digital Accessibility Literacy as a pedagogical framework
- Identifies gaps in current accessibility education across disciplines
- Proposes encoding/decoding model for accessibility competencies
- Promotes interdisciplinary collaboration in accessibility education

**Paper Structure:**
1. Introduction - Context and motivation for DAL
2. Teaching Accessibility in Various Disciplines - Current state in CS and pedagogy
3. Concepts of Literacy in Teaching and Education - Theoretical foundation
4. Draft of Digital Accessibility Literacy - The proposed framework
5. Discussion and Conclusion - Benefits and future directions
6. References - 14 citations
