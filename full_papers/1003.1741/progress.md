## Summary

All 8 main sections successfully translated from English to Arabic. The paper presents a methodology for formalizing and validating safety-critical requirements using first-order temporal logic combined with hybrid logic. The approach was applied to the European Train Control System (ETCS) project.

### Key Technical Terms Translated:
- Formal methods → الأساليب الرسمية
- Model checking → فحص النماذج
- Satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) → نظرية الإرضاء بالقياس
- Hybrid logic → المنطق الهجين
- Property-based approach → النهج القائم على الخصائص
- CEGAR → التحسين التجريدي الموجه بالأمثلة المضادة

### Challenges Addressed:
- Complex technical terminology requiring consistent translation
- Multi-layered logical concepts (first-order, temporal, hybrid)
- Industrial case study context (ETCS project)
- Tool integration details (NuSMV, RequisitePro, RSA)

## Notes
- Paper is 8 pages long (plus references)
- Applied to European Train Control System (ETCS) project
- Combines formal methods: first-order, temporal, and hybrid logic
- Uses model checking and SMT solvers
- Industrial partnership with RINA, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and Dr. Graband and Partners
