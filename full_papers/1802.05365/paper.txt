Abstract
We introduce a new type of deep contextual-
ized word representation that models both (1)
complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syn-
tax and semantics), and (2) how these uses
vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model
polysemy). Our word vectors are learned func-
tions of the internal states of a deep bidirec-
tional language model (biLM), which is pre-
trained on a large text corpus. We show that
these representations can be easily added to
existing models and signiﬁcantly improve the
state of the art across six challenging NLP
problems, including question answering, tex-
tual entailment and sentiment analysis. We
also present an analysis showing that exposing
the deep internals of the pre-trained network is
crucial, allowing downstream models to mix
different types of semi-supervision signals.
1 Introduction
Pre-trained word representations (Mikolov et al.,
2013; Pennington et al., 2014) are a key compo-
nent in many neural language understanding mod-
els. However, learning high quality representa-
tions can be challenging. They should ideally
model both (1) complex characteristics of word
use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these
uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model
polysemy). In this paper, we introduce a new type
ofdeep contextualized word representation that
directly addresses both challenges, can be easily
integrated into existing models, and signiﬁcantly
improves the state of the art in every considered
case across a range of challenging language un-
derstanding problems.
Our representations differ from traditional word
type embeddings in that each token is assigned a
representation that is a function of the entire input
sentence. We use vectors derived from a bidirec-
tional LSTM that is trained with a coupled lan-guage model (LM) objective on a large text cor-
pus. For this reason, we call them ELMo (Em-
beddings from Language Models) representations.
Unlike previous approaches for learning contextu-
alized word vectors (Peters et al., 2017; McCann
et al., 2017), ELMo representations are deep, in
the sense that they are a function of all of the in-
ternal layers of the biLM. More speciﬁcally, we
learn a linear combination of the vectors stacked
above each input word for each end task, which
markedly improves performance over just using
the top LSTM layer.
Combining the internal states in this manner al-
lows for very rich word representations. Using in-
trinsic evaluations, we show that the higher-level
LSTM states capture context-dependent aspects
of word meaning (e.g., they can be used with-
out modiﬁcation to perform well on supervised
word sense disambiguation tasks) while lower-
level states model aspects of syntax (e.g., they can
be used to do part-of-speech tagging). Simultane-
ously exposing all of these signals is highly bene-
ﬁcial, allowing the learned models select the types
of semi-supervision that are most useful for each
end task.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ELMo
representations work extremely well in practice.
We ﬁrst show that they can be easily added to
existing models for six diverse and challenging
language understanding problems, including tex-
tual entailment, question answering and sentiment
analysis. The addition of ELMo representations
alone signiﬁcantly improves the state of the art
in every case, including up to 20% relative error
reductions. For tasks where direct comparisons
are possible, ELMo outperforms CoVe (McCann
et al., 2017), which computes contextualized rep-
resentations using a neural machine translation en-
coder. Finally, an analysis of both ELMo and
CoVe reveals that deep representations outperformarXiv:1802.05365v2  [cs.CL]  22 Mar 2018

those derived from just the top layer of an LSTM.
Our trained models and code are publicly avail-
able, and we expect that ELMo will provide simi-
lar gains for many other NLP problems.1
2 Related work
Due to their ability to capture syntactic and se-
mantic information of words from large scale un-
labeled text, pretrained word vectors (Turian et al.,
2010; Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,
2014) are a standard component of most state-of-
the-art NLP architectures, including for question
answering (Liu et al., 2017), textual entailment
(Chen et al., 2017) and semantic role labeling
(He et al., 2017). However, these approaches for
learning word vectors only allow a single context-
independent representation for each word.
Previously proposed methods overcome some
of the shortcomings of traditional word vectors
by either enriching them with subword informa-
tion (e.g., Wieting et al., 2016; Bojanowski et al.,
2017) or learning separate vectors for each word
sense (e.g., Neelakantan et al., 2014). Our ap-
proach also beneﬁts from subword units through
the use of character convolutions, and we seam-
lessly incorporate multi-sense information into
downstream tasks without explicitly training to
predict predeﬁned sense classes.
Other recent work has also focused on
learning context-dependent representations.
context2vec (Melamud et al., 2016) uses a
bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM;
Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode the
context around a pivot word. Other approaches
for learning contextual embeddings include the
pivot word itself in the representation and are
computed with the encoder of either a supervised
neural machine translation (MT) system (CoVe;
McCann et al., 2017) or an unsupervised lan-
guage model (Peters et al., 2017). Both of these
approaches beneﬁt from large datasets, although
the MT approach is limited by the size of parallel
corpora. In this paper, we take full advantage of
access to plentiful monolingual data, and train
our biLM on a corpus with approximately 30
million sentences (Chelba et al., 2014). We also
generalize these approaches to deep contextual
representations, which we show work well across
a broad range of diverse NLP tasks.
1http://allennlp.org/elmoPrevious work has also shown that different lay-
ers of deep biRNNs encode different types of in-
formation. For example, introducing multi-task
syntactic supervision (e.g., part-of-speech tags) at
the lower levels of a deep LSTM can improve
overall performance of higher level tasks such as
dependency parsing (Hashimoto et al., 2017) or
CCG super tagging (Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016).
In an RNN-based encoder-decoder machine trans-
lation system, Belinkov et al. (2017) showed that
the representations learned at the ﬁrst layer in a 2-
layer LSTM encoder are better at predicting POS
tags then second layer. Finally, the top layer of an
LSTM for encoding word context (Melamud et al.,
2016) has been shown to learn representations of
word sense. We show that similar signals are also
induced by the modiﬁed language model objective
of our ELMo representations, and it can be very
beneﬁcial to learn models for downstream tasks
that mix these different types of semi-supervision.
Dai and Le (2015) and Ramachandran et al.
(2017) pretrain encoder-decoder pairs using lan-
guage models and sequence autoencoders and then
ﬁne tune with task speciﬁc supervision. In con-
trast, after pretraining the biLM with unlabeled
data, we ﬁx the weights and add additional task-
speciﬁc model capacity, allowing us to leverage
large, rich and universal biLM representations for
cases where downstream training data size dictates
a smaller supervised model.
3 ELMo: Embeddings from Language
Models
Unlike most widely used word embeddings (Pen-
nington et al., 2014), ELMo word representations
are functions of the entire input sentence, as de-
scribed in this section. They are computed on top
of two-layer biLMs with character convolutions
(Sec. 3.1), as a linear function of the internal net-
work states (Sec. 3.2). This setup allows us to do
semi-supervised learning, where the biLM is pre-
trained at a large scale (Sec. 3.4) and easily incor-
porated into a wide range of existing neural NLP
architectures (Sec. 3.3).
3.1 Bidirectional language models
Given a sequence of Ntokens, (t1;t2;:::;t N), a
forward language model computes the probability
of the sequence by modeling the probability of to-

kentkgiven the history (t1;:::;t k 1):
p(t1;t2;:::;t N) =NY
k=1p(tkjt1;t2;:::;t k 1):
Recent state-of-the-art neural language models
(J´ozefowicz et al., 2016; Melis et al., 2017; Mer-
ity et al., 2017) compute a context-independent to-
ken representation xLM
k(via token embeddings or
a CNN over characters) then pass it through Llay-
ers of forward LSTMs. At each position k, each
LSTM layer outputs a context-dependent repre-
sentation  !hLM
k;jwherej= 1;:::;L . The top layer
LSTM output,  !hLM
k;L, is used to predict the next
tokentk+1with a Softmax layer.
A backward LM is similar to a forward LM, ex-
cept it runs over the sequence in reverse, predict-
ing the previous token given the future context:
p(t1;t2;:::;t N) =NY
k=1p(tkjtk+1;tk+2;:::;t N):
It can be implemented in an analogous way to a
forward LM, with each backward LSTM layer j
in aLlayer deep model producing representations  hLM
k;joftkgiven (tk+1;:::;t N).
A biLM combines both a forward and backward
LM. Our formulation jointly maximizes the log
likelihood of the forward and backward directions:
NX
k=1( logp(tkjt1;:::;t k 1; x;  !LSTM;s)
+ logp(tkjtk+1;:::;t N; x;  LSTM;s) ):
We tie the parameters for both the token represen-
tation ( x) and Softmax layer ( s) in the forward
and backward direction while maintaining sepa-
rate parameters for the LSTMs in each direction.
Overall, this formulation is similar to the approach
of Peters et al. (2017), with the exception that we
share some weights between directions instead of
using completely independent parameters. In the
next section, we depart from previous work by in-
troducing a new approach for learning word rep-
resentations that are a linear combination of the
biLM layers.
3.2 ELMo
ELMo is a task speciﬁc combination of the in-
termediate layer representations in the biLM. Foreach tokentk, aL-layer biLM computes a set of
2L+ 1representations
Rk=fxLM
k;  !hLM
k;j;  hLM
k;jjj= 1;:::;Lg
=fhLM
k;jjj= 0;:::;Lg;
where hLM
k;0is the token layer and hLM
k;j=
[  !hLM
k;j;  hLM
k;j], for each biLSTM layer.
For inclusion in a downstream model, ELMo
collapses all layers in Rinto a single vector,
ELMo k=E(Rk;e). In the simplest case,
ELMo just selects the top layer, E(Rk) =hLM
k;L,
as in TagLM (Peters et al., 2017) and CoVe (Mc-
Cann et al., 2017). More generally, we compute a
task speciﬁc weighting of all biLM layers:
ELMotask
k=E(Rk; task) =taskLX
j=0stask
jhLM
k;j:

In (1), staskare softmax-normalized weights and

portance to aid the optimization process (see sup-
plemental material for details). Considering that
the activations of each biLM layer have a different
distribution, in some cases it also helped to apply
layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) to each biLM
layer before weighting.
3.3 Using biLMs for supervised NLP tasks
Given a pre-trained biLM and a supervised archi-
tecture for a target NLP task, it is a simple process
to use the biLM to improve the task model. We
simply run the biLM and record all of the layer
representations for each word. Then, we let the
end task model learn a linear combination of these
representations, as described below.
First consider the lowest layers of the super-
vised model without the biLM. Most supervised
NLP models share a common architecture at the
lowest layers, allowing us to add ELMo in a
consistent, uniﬁed manner. Given a sequence
of tokens (t1;:::;t N), it is standard to form a
context-independent token representation xkfor
each token position using pre-trained word em-
beddings and optionally character-based represen-
tations. Then, the model forms a context-sensitive
representation hk, typically using either bidirec-
tional RNNs, CNNs, or feed forward networks.
To add ELMo to the supervised model, we
ﬁrst freeze the weights of the biLM and then

concatenate the ELMo vector ELMotask
k with
xkand pass the ELMo enhanced representation
[xk;ELMotask
k]into the task RNN. For some
tasks (e.g., SNLI, SQuAD), we observe further
improvements by also including ELMo at the out-
put of the task RNN by introducing another set
of output speciﬁc linear weights and replacing hk
with [hk;ELMotask
k]. As the remainder of the
supervised model remains unchanged, these addi-
tions can happen within the context of more com-
plex neural models. For example, see the SNLI
experiments in Sec. 4 where a bi-attention layer
follows the biLSTMs, or the coreference resolu-
tion experiments where a clustering model is lay-
ered on top of the biLSTMs.
Finally, we found it beneﬁcial to add a moder-
ate amount of dropout to ELMo (Srivastava et al.,
2014) and in some cases to regularize the ELMo
weights by adding kwk2
2to the loss. This im-
poses an inductive bias on the ELMo weights to
stay close to an average of all biLM layers.
3.4 Pre-trained bidirectional language model
architecture
The pre-trained biLMs in this paper are similar to
the architectures in J ´ozefowicz et al. (2016) and
Kim et al. (2015), but modiﬁed to support joint
training of both directions and add a residual con-
nection between LSTM layers. We focus on large
scale biLMs in this work, as Peters et al. (2017)
highlighted the importance of using biLMs over
forward-only LMs and large scale training.
To balance overall language model perplexity
with model size and computational requirements
for downstream tasks while maintaining a purely
character-based input representation, we halved all
embedding and hidden dimensions from the single
best model CNN-BIG-LSTM in J´ozefowicz et al.
(2016). The ﬁnal model uses L= 2biLSTM lay-
ers with 4096 units and 512 dimension projections
and a residual connection from the ﬁrst to second
layer. The context insensitive type representation
uses 2048 character n-gram convolutional ﬁlters
followed by two highway layers (Srivastava et al.,
2015) and a linear projection down to a 512 repre-
sentation. As a result, the biLM provides three lay-
ers of representations for each input token, includ-
ing those outside the training set due to the purely
character input. In contrast, traditional word em-
bedding methods only provide one layer of repre-
sentation for tokens in a ﬁxed vocabulary.After training for 10 epochs on the 1B Word
Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2014), the average for-
ward and backward perplexities is 39.7, compared
to 30.0 for the forward CNN-BIG-LSTM . Gener-
ally, we found the forward and backward perplex-
ities to be approximately equal, with the backward
value slightly lower.
Once pretrained, the biLM can compute repre-
sentations for any task. In some cases, ﬁne tuning
the biLM on domain speciﬁc data leads to signiﬁ-
cant drops in perplexity and an increase in down-
stream task performance. This can be seen as a
type of domain transfer for the biLM. As a result,
in most cases we used a ﬁne-tuned biLM in the
downstream task. See supplemental material for
details.
4 Evaluation
Table 1 shows the performance of ELMo across a
diverse set of six benchmark NLP tasks. In every
task considered, simply adding ELMo establishes
a new state-of-the-art result, with relative error re-
ductions ranging from 6 - 20% over strong base
models. This is a very general result across a di-
verse set model architectures and language under-
standing tasks. In the remainder of this section we
provide high-level sketches of the individual task
results; see the supplemental material for full ex-
perimental details.
Question answering The Stanford Question
Answering Dataset (SQuAD) (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016) contains 100K+ crowd sourced question-
answer pairs where the answer is a span in a given
Wikipedia paragraph. Our baseline model (Clark
and Gardner, 2017) is an improved version of the
Bidirectional Attention Flow model in Seo et al.
(BiDAF; 2017). It adds a self-attention layer af-
ter the bidirectional attention component, simpli-
ﬁes some of the pooling operations and substitutes
the LSTMs for gated recurrent units (GRUs; Cho
et al., 2014). After adding ELMo to the baseline
model, test set F 1improved by 4.7% from 81.1%
to 85.8%, a 24.9% relative error reduction over the
baseline, and improving the overall single model
state-of-the-art by 1.4%. A 11 member ensem-
ble pushes F 1to 87.4, the overall state-of-the-art
at time of submission to the leaderboard.2The
increase of 4.7% with ELMo is also signiﬁcantly
larger then the 1.8% improvement from adding
CoVe to a baseline model (McCann et al., 2017).

and standard deviation across ﬁve runs with different random seeds. The “increase” column lists both the absolute
and relative improvements over our baseline.
Textual entailment Textual entailment is the
task of determining whether a “hypothesis” is
true, given a “premise”. The Stanford Natu-
ral Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman
et al., 2015) provides approximately 550K hypoth-
esis/premise pairs. Our baseline, the ESIM se-
quence model from Chen et al. (2017), uses a biL-
STM to encode the premise and hypothesis, fol-
lowed by a matrix attention layer, a local infer-
ence layer, another biLSTM inference composi-
tion layer, and ﬁnally a pooling operation before
the output layer. Overall, adding ELMo to the
ESIM model improves accuracy by an average of
0.7% across ﬁve random seeds. A ﬁve member
ensemble pushes the overall accuracy to 89.3%,
exceeding the previous ensemble best of 88.9%
(Gong et al., 2018).
Semantic role labeling A semantic role label-
ing (SRL) system models the predicate-argument
structure of a sentence, and is often described as
answering “Who did what to whom”. He et al.
(2017) modeled SRL as a BIO tagging problem
and used an 8-layer deep biLSTM with forward
and backward directions interleaved, following
Zhou and Xu (2015). As shown in Table 1, when
adding ELMo to a re-implementation of He et al.
(2017) the single model test set F 1jumped 3.2%
from 81.4% to 84.6% – a new state-of-the-art on
the OntoNotes benchmark (Pradhan et al., 2013),
even improving over the previous best ensemble
result by 1.2%.
Coreference resolution Coreference resolution
is the task of clustering mentions in text that re-
fer to the same underlying real world entities. Our
baseline model is the end-to-end span-based neu-
ral model of Lee et al. (2017). It uses a biLSTMand attention mechanism to ﬁrst compute span
representations and then applies a softmax men-
tion ranking model to ﬁnd coreference chains. In
our experiments with the OntoNotes coreference
annotations from the CoNLL 2012 shared task
(Pradhan et al., 2012), adding ELMo improved the
average F 1by 3.2% from 67.2 to 70.4, establish-
ing a new state of the art, again improving over the
previous best ensemble result by 1.6% F 1.
Named entity extraction The CoNLL 2003
NER task (Sang and Meulder, 2003) consists of
newswire from the Reuters RCV1 corpus tagged
with four different entity types ( PER,LOC,ORG,
MISC ). Following recent state-of-the-art systems
(Lample et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2017), the base-
line model uses pre-trained word embeddings, a
character-based CNN representation, two biLSTM
layers and a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) loss
(Lafferty et al., 2001), similar to Collobert et al.
(2011). As shown in Table 1, our ELMo enhanced
biLSTM-CRF achieves 92.22% F 1averaged over
ﬁve runs. The key difference between our system
and the previous state of the art from Peters et al.
(2017) is that we allowed the task model to learn a
weighted average of all biLM layers, whereas Pe-
ters et al. (2017) only use the top biLM layer. As
shown in Sec. 5.1, using all layers instead of just
the last layer improves performance across multi-
ple tasks.
Sentiment analysis The ﬁne-grained sentiment
classiﬁcation task in the Stanford Sentiment Tree-
bank (SST-5; Socher et al., 2013) involves select-
ing one of ﬁve labels (from very negative to very
positive) to describe a sentence from a movie re-
view. The sentences contain diverse linguistic
phenomena such as idioms and complex syntac-

tic constructions such as negations that are difﬁ-
cult for models to learn. Our baseline model is
the biattentive classiﬁcation network (BCN) from
McCann et al. (2017), which also held the prior
state-of-the-art result when augmented with CoVe
embeddings. Replacing CoVe with ELMo in the
BCN model results in a 1.0% absolute accuracy
improvement over the state of the art.
5 Analysis
This section provides an ablation analysis to vali-
date our chief claims and to elucidate some inter-
esting aspects of ELMo representations. Sec. 5.1
shows that using deep contextual representations
in downstream tasks improves performance over
previous work that uses just the top layer, regard-
less of whether they are produced from a biLM or
MT encoder, and that ELMo representations pro-
vide the best overall performance. Sec. 5.3 ex-
plores the different types of contextual informa-
tion captured in biLMs and uses two intrinsic eval-
uations to show that syntactic information is better
represented at lower layers while semantic infor-
mation is captured a higher layers, consistent with
MT encoders. It also shows that our biLM consis-
tently provides richer representations then CoVe.
Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity to where
ELMo is included in the task model (Sec. 5.2),
training set size (Sec. 5.4), and visualize the ELMo
learned weights across the tasks (Sec. 5.5).5.1 Alternate layer weighting schemes
There are many alternatives to Equation 1 for com-
bining the biLM layers. Previous work on con-
textual representations used only the last layer,
whether it be from a biLM (Peters et al., 2017) or
an MT encoder (CoVe; McCann et al., 2017). The
choice of the regularization parameter is also
important, as large values such as = 1 effec-
tively reduce the weighting function to a simple
average over the layers, while smaller values (e.g.,
= 0:001) allow the layer weights to vary.
Table 2 compares these alternatives for SQuAD,
SNLI and SRL. Including representations from all
layers improves overall performance over just us-
ing the last layer, and including contextual rep-
resentations from the last layer improves perfor-
mance over the baseline. For example, in the
case of SQuAD, using just the last biLM layer im-
proves development F 1by 3.9% over the baseline.
Averaging all biLM layers instead of using just the
last layer improves F 1another 0.3% (comparing
“Last Only” to =1 columns), and allowing the
task model to learn individual layer weights im-
proves F 1another 0.2% ( =1 vs.=0.001). A
smallis preferred in most cases with ELMo, al-
though for NER, a task with a smaller training set,
the results are insensitive to (not shown).
The overall trend is similar with CoVe but with
smaller increases over the baseline. For SNLI, av-
eraging all layers with =1 improves development
accuracy from 88.2 to 88.7% over using just the
last layer. SRL F 1increased a marginal 0.1% to
82.2 for the =1 case compared to using the last
layer only.
5.2 Where to include ELMo?
All of the task architectures in this paper include
word embeddings only as input to the lowest layer
biRNN. However, we ﬁnd that including ELMo at
the output of the biRNN in task-speciﬁc architec-
tures improves overall results for some tasks. As
shown in Table 3, including ELMo at both the in-
put and output layers for SNLI and SQuAD im-
proves over just the input layer, but for SRL (and
coreference resolution, not shown) performance is
highest when it is included at just the input layer.
One possible explanation for this result is that both
the SNLI and SQuAD architectures use attention
layers after the biRNN, so introducing ELMo at
this layer allows the model to attend directly to the
biLM’s internal representations. In the SRL case,

5.3 What information is captured by the
biLM’s representations?
Since adding ELMo improves task performance
over word vectors alone, the biLM’s contextual
representations must encode information gener-
ally useful for NLP tasks that is not captured
in word vectors. Intuitively, the biLM must
be disambiguating the meaning of words using
their context. Consider “play”, a highly poly-
semous word. The top of Table 4 lists near-
est neighbors to “play” using GloVe vectors.
They are spread across several parts of speech
(e.g., “played”, “playing” as verbs, and “player”,
“game” as nouns) but concentrated in the sports-
related senses of “play”. In contrast, the bottom
two rows show nearest neighbor sentences from
the SemCor dataset (see below) using the biLM’s
context representation of “play” in the source sen-
tence. In these cases, the biLM is able to disam-
biguate both the part of speech and word sense in
the source sentence.
These observations can be quantiﬁed using anModel Acc.

intrinsic evaluation of the contextual representa-
tions similar to Belinkov et al. (2017). To isolate
the information encoded by the biLM, the repre-
sentations are used to directly make predictions for
a ﬁne grained word sense disambiguation (WSD)
task and a POS tagging task. Using this approach,
it is also possible to compare to CoVe, and across
each of the individual layers.
Word sense disambiguation Given a sentence,
we can use the biLM representations to predict
the sense of a target word using a simple 1-
nearest neighbor approach, similar to Melamud
et al. (2016). To do so, we ﬁrst use the biLM
to compute representations for all words in Sem-
Cor 3.0, our training corpus (Miller et al., 1994),
and then take the average representation for each
sense. At test time, we again use the biLM to com-
pute representations for a given target word and
take the nearest neighbor sense from the training
set, falling back to the ﬁrst sense from WordNet
for lemmas not observed during training.
Table 5 compares WSD results using the eval-
uation framework from Raganato et al. (2017b)
across the same suite of four test sets in Raganato
et al. (2017a). Overall, the biLM top layer rep-

resentations have F 1of 69.0 and are better at
WSD then the ﬁrst layer. This is competitive with
a state-of-the-art WSD-speciﬁc supervised model
using hand crafted features (Iacobacci et al., 2016)
and a task speciﬁc biLSTM that is also trained
with auxiliary coarse-grained semantic labels and
POS tags (Raganato et al., 2017a). The CoVe
biLSTM layers follow a similar pattern to those
from the biLM (higher overall performance at the
second layer compared to the ﬁrst); however, our
biLM outperforms the CoVe biLSTM, which trails
the WordNet ﬁrst sense baseline.
POS tagging To examine whether the biLM
captures basic syntax, we used the context repre-
sentations as input to a linear classiﬁer that pre-
dicts POS tags with the Wall Street Journal portion
of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993).
As the linear classiﬁer adds only a small amount
of model capacity, this is direct test of the biLM’s
representations. Similar to WSD, the biLM rep-
resentations are competitive with carefully tuned,
task speciﬁc biLSTMs (Ling et al., 2015; Ma and
Hovy, 2016). However, unlike WSD, accuracies
using the ﬁrst biLM layer are higher than the
top layer, consistent with results from deep biL-
STMs in multi-task training (Søgaard and Gold-
berg, 2016; Hashimoto et al., 2017) and MT (Be-
linkov et al., 2017). CoVe POS tagging accuracies
follow the same pattern as those from the biLM,
and just like for WSD, the biLM achieves higher
accuracies than the CoVe encoder.
Implications for supervised tasks Taken to-
gether, these experiments conﬁrm different layers
in the biLM represent different types of informa-
tion and explain why including all biLM layers is
important for the highest performance in down-
stream tasks. In addition, the biLM’s representa-
tions are more transferable to WSD and POS tag-
ging than those in CoVe, helping to illustrate why
ELMo outperforms CoVe in downstream tasks.
5.4 Sample efﬁciency
Adding ELMo to a model increases the sample ef-
ﬁciency considerably, both in terms of number of
parameter updates to reach state-of-the-art perfor-
mance and the overall training set size. For ex-
ample, the SRL model reaches a maximum devel-
opment F 1after 486 epochs of training without
ELMo. After adding ELMo, the model exceeds
the baseline maximum at epoch 10, a 98% relative
decrease in the number of updates needed to reach

mance for SNLI and SRL as the training set size is var-
ied from 0.1% to 100%.

layer weights across tasks and ELMo locations. Nor-

zontal lines and those greater then 2=3are speckled.
the same level of performance.
In addition, ELMo-enhanced models use
smaller training sets more efﬁciently than mod-
els without ELMo. Figure 1 compares the per-
formance of baselines models with and without
ELMo as the percentage of the full training set is
varied from 0.1% to 100%. Improvements with
ELMo are largest for smaller training sets and
signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of training data
needed to reach a given level of performance. In
the SRL case, the ELMo model with 1% of the
training set has about the same F 1as the baseline
model with 10% of the training set.
5.5 Visualization of learned weights
Figure 2 visualizes the softmax-normalized
learned layer weights. At the input layer, the
task model favors the ﬁrst biLSTM layer. For
coreference and SQuAD, the this is strongly
favored, but the distribution is less peaked for
the other tasks. The output layer weights are
relatively balanced, with a slight preference for
the lower layers.

6 Conclusion
We have introduced a general approach for learn-
ing high-quality deep context-dependent represen-
tations from biLMs, and shown large improve-
ments when applying ELMo to a broad range of
NLP tasks. Through ablations and other controlled
experiments, we have also conﬁrmed that the
biLM layers efﬁciently encode different types of
syntactic and semantic information about words-
in-context, and that using all layers improves over-
all task performance.

A Supplemental Material to accompany
Deep contextualized word
representations
This supplement contains details of the model ar-
chitectures, training routines and hyper-parameter
choices for the state-of-the-art models in Section
4.
All of the individual models share a common ar-
chitecture in the lowest layers with a context inde-
pendent token representation below several layers
of stacked RNNs – LSTMs in every case except
the SQuAD model that uses GRUs.
A.1 Fine tuning biLM
As noted in Sec. 3.4, ﬁne tuning the biLM on task
speciﬁc data typically resulted in signiﬁcant drops
in perplexity. To ﬁne tune on a given task, the
supervised labels were temporarily ignored, the
biLM ﬁne tuned for one epoch on the training split
and evaluated on the development split. Once ﬁne
tuned, the biLM weights were ﬁxed during task
training.
Table 7 lists the development set perplexities for
the considered tasks. In every case except CoNLL
2012, ﬁne tuning results in a large improvement in
perplexity, e.g., from 72.1 to 16.8 for SNLI.
The impact of ﬁne tuning on supervised perfor-
mance is task dependent. In the case of SNLI,
ﬁne tuning the biLM increased development accu-
racy 0.6% from 88.9% to 89.5% for our single best
model. However, for sentiment classiﬁcation de-
velopment set accuracy is approximately the same
regardless whether a ﬁne tuned biLM was used.
A.2 Importance of in Eqn. (1)
Theparameter in Eqn. (1) was of practical im-
portance to aid optimization, due to the differ-
ent distributions between the biLM internal rep-
resentations and the task speciﬁc representations.
It is especially important in the last-only case in
Sec. 5.1. Without this parameter, the last-only
case performed poorly (well below the baseline)
for SNLI and training failed completely for SRL.
A.3 Textual Entailment
Our baseline SNLI model is the ESIM sequence
model from Chen et al. (2017). Following the
original implementation, we used 300 dimensions
for all LSTM and feed forward layers and pre-
trained 300 dimensional GloVe embeddings that
were ﬁxed during training. For regularization, weDatasetBefore

added 50% variational dropout (Gal and Ghahra-
mani, 2016) to the input of each LSTM layer and
50% dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) at the input
to the ﬁnal two fully connected layers. All feed
forward layers use ReLU activations. Parame-
ters were optimized using Adam (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with gradient norms clipped at 5.0 and ini-
tial learning rate 0.0004, decreasing by half each
time accuracy on the development set did not in-
crease in subsequent epochs. The batch size was

The best ELMo conﬁguration added ELMo vec-
tors to both the input and output of the lowest
layer LSTM, using (1) with layer normalization
and= 0:001. Due to the increased number of
parameters in the ELMo model, we added `2reg-
ularization with regularization coefﬁcient 0.0001
to all recurrent and feed forward weight matrices
and 50% dropout after the attention layer.
Table 8 compares test set accuracy of our sys-
tem to previously published systems. Overall,
adding ELMo to the ESIM model improved ac-
curacy by 0.7% establishing a new single model
state-of-the-art of 88.7%, and a ﬁve member en-
semble pushes the overall accuracy to 89.3%.
A.4 Question Answering
Our QA model is a simpliﬁed version of the model
from Clark and Gardner (2017). It embeds to-
kens by concatenating each token’s case-sensitive
300 dimensional GloVe word vector (Penning-
ton et al., 2014) with a character-derived embed-
ding produced using a convolutional neural net-
work followed by max-pooling on learned char-
acter embeddings. The token embeddings are
passed through a shared bi-directional GRU, and
then the bi-directional attention mechanism from
BiDAF (Seo et al., 2017). The augmented con-

text vectors are then passed through a linear layer
with ReLU activations, a residual self-attention
layer that uses a GRU followed by the same atten-
tion mechanism applied context-to-context, and
another linear layer with ReLU activations. Fi-
nally, the results are fed through linear layers to
predict the start and end token of the answer.
Variational dropout is used before the input to
the GRUs and the linear layers at a rate of 0.2. A
dimensionality of 90 is used for the GRUs, and
180 for the linear layers. We optimize the model
using Adadelta with a batch size of 45. At test
time we use an exponential moving average of the
weights and limit the output span to be of at most
size 17. We do not update the word vectors during
training.
Performance was highest when adding ELMo
without layer normalization to both the input and
output of the contextual GRU layer and leaving the
ELMo weights unregularized ( = 0).
Table 9 compares test set results from the
SQuAD leaderboard as of November 17, 2017
when we submitted our system. Overall, our sub-
mission had the highest single model and ensem-
ble results, improving the previous single model
result (SAN) by 1.4% F 1and our baseline by
4.2%. A 11 member ensemble pushes F 1to
87.4%, 1.0% increase over the previous ensemble
best.
A.5 Semantic Role Labeling
Our baseline SRL model is an exact reimplemen-
tation of (He et al., 2017). Words are represented
using a concatenation of 100 dimensional vector
representations, initialized using GloVe (Penning-
ton et al., 2014) and a binary, per-word predicate
feature, represented using an 100 dimensional em-
3A comprehensive comparison can be found at https:
//nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/bedding. This 200 dimensional token represen-
tation is then passed through an 8 layer “inter-
leaved” biLSTM with a 300 dimensional hidden
size, in which the directions of the LSTM layers
alternate per layer. This deep LSTM uses High-
way connections (Srivastava et al., 2015) between
layers and variational recurrent dropout (Gal and
Ghahramani, 2016). This deep representation is
then projected using a ﬁnal dense layer followed
by a softmax activation to form a distribution over
all possible tags. Labels consist of semantic roles
from PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) augmented
with a BIO labeling scheme to represent argu-
ment spans. During training, we minimize the
negative log likelihood of the tag sequence using
Adadelta with a learning rate of 1.0 and = 0:95
(Zeiler, 2012). At test time, we perform Viterbi
decoding to enforce valid spans using BIO con-
straints. Variational dropout of 10% is added to
all LSTM hidden layers. Gradients are clipped if
their value exceeds 1.0. Models are trained for 500
epochs or until validation F1 does not improve for
200 epochs, whichever is sooner. The pretrained
GloVe vectors are ﬁne-tuned during training. The
ﬁnal dense layer and all cells of all LSTMs are ini-
tialized to be orthogonal. The forget gate bias is
initialized to 1 for all LSTMs, with all other gates
initialized to 0, as per (J ´ozefowicz et al., 2015).
Table 10 compares test set F1 scores of our
ELMo augmented implementation of (He et al.,
2017) with previous results. Our single model
score of 84.6 F1 represents a new state-of-the-art
result on the CONLL 2012 Semantic Role Label-
ing task, surpassing the previous single model re-
sult by 2.9 F1 and a 5-model ensemble by 1.2 F1.

biLM layers using (1) without any regularization
(= 0) or layer normalization. 50% dropout was
added to the ELMo representations.
Table 11 compares our results with previously
published results. Overall, we improve the single
model state-of-the-art by 3.2% average F 1, and our
single model result improves the previous ensem-
ble best by 1.6% F 1. Adding ELMo to the output
from the biLSTM in addition to the biLSTM input
reduced F 1by approximately 0.7% (not shown).A.7 Named Entity Recognition
Our baseline NER model concatenates 50 dimen-
sional pre-trained Senna vectors (Collobert et al.,
2011) with a CNN character based representation.
The character representation uses 16 dimensional
character embeddings and 128 convolutional ﬁl-
ters of width three characters, a ReLU activation
and by max pooling. The token representation is
passed through two biLSTM layers, the ﬁrst with
200 hidden units and the second with 100 hid-
den units before a ﬁnal dense layer and softmax
layer. During training, we use a CRF loss and at
test time perform decoding using the Viterbi algo-
rithm while ensuring that the output tag sequence
is valid.
Variational dropout is added to the input of both
biLSTM layers. During training the gradients are
rescaled if their `2norm exceeds 5.0 and param-
eters updated using Adam with constant learning
rate of 0.001. The pre-trained Senna embeddings
are ﬁne tuned during training. We employ early
stopping on the development set and report the av-
eraged test set score across ﬁve runs with different
random seeds.
ELMo was added to the input of the lowest layer
task biLSTM. As the CoNLL 2003 NER data set
is relatively small, we found the best performance
by constraining the trainable layer weights to be
effectively constant by setting = 0:1with (1).
Table 12 compares test set F 1scores of our
ELMo enhanced biLSTM-CRF tagger with previ-
ous results. Overall, the 92.22% F 1from our sys-
tem establishes a new state-of-the-art. When com-
pared to Peters et al. (2017), using representations

A.8 Sentiment classiﬁcation
We use almost the same biattention classiﬁcation
network architecture described in McCann et al.
(2017), with the exception of replacing the ﬁnal
maxout network with a simpler feedforward net-
work composed of two ReLu layers with dropout.
A BCN model with a batch-normalized maxout
network reached signiﬁcantly lower validation ac-
curacies in our experiments, although there may
be discrepancies between our implementation and
that of McCann et al. (2017). To match the CoVe
training setup, we only train on phrases that con-
tain four or more tokens. We use 300-d hidden
states for the biLSTM and optimize the model pa-
rameters with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) us-
ing a learning rate of 0.0001. The trainable biLM
layer weights are regularized by = 0:001, and
we add ELMo to both the input and output of the
biLSTM; the output ELMo vectors are computed
with a second biLSTM and concatenated to the in-
put.
