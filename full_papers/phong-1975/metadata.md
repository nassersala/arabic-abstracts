## Paper Significance

This seminal paper introduced the **Phong reflection model** and **Phong shading**, which became fundamental techniques in computer graphics for realistic image rendering. The paper presents a shading algorithm that considers:
- Ambient light
- Diffuse reflection (Lambertian)
- Specular reflection with highlights
- Interpolation across polygon surfaces

The Phong shading technique revolutionized 3D graphics rendering and is still widely taught in computer graphics courses today.
