## Paper Significance

This is a **REVOLUTIONARY** paper that:
- Introduced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), spawning an entire field of neural rendering
- Demonstrated photorealistic novel view synthesis using MLPs
- Achieved state-of-the-art results with continuous 5D scene representation
- Inspired thousands of follow-up works (3D Gaussian Splatting, Instant-NGP, etc.)
- Fundamentally changed how we think about 3D scene representation

**Target Quality:** ≥ 0.85 for all sections (high importance given revolutionary nature)
