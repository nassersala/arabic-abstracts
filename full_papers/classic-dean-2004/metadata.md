## Paper Overview

MapReduce is one of the most influential papers in distributed systems and big data processing. It introduced a programming model that allows developers to process massive datasets across thousands of machines without dealing with parallelization, fault tolerance, and data distribution complexity. This paper has been foundational to the development of systems like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
