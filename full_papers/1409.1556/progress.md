## Summary

This translation covers the complete VGGNet paper (ICLR 2015), which introduced VGG-16 and VGG-19 architectures. The paper demonstrates that increasing network depth (16-19 weight layers) with small 3×3 convolution filters significantly improves image classification accuracy. All sections have been translated following the quality standards with minimum scores above 0.85.
