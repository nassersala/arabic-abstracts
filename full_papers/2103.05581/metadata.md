## Paper Overview

This paper presents the Agda Universal Algebra Library (UALib), a formalized library of types and programs (theorems and proofs) developed to formalize the foundations of universal algebra in dependent type theory using the Agda programming language and proof assistant. The library includes substantial definitions, theorems, and proofs from general algebra and equational logic, demonstrating the power of inductive and dependent types for representing and reasoning about algebraic structures.
