## Abstract

Industrial applications involving formal methods are still exceptions to the general rule. Lack of understanding, employees without proper education, difficulty to integrate existing development cycles, no explicit requirement from the market, etc. are explanations often heard for not being more formal. This article reports some experience about a game changer that is going to seamlessly integrate formal methods into safety critical systems engineering.
