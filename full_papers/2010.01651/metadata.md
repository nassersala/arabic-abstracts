## Paper Summary

This paper investigates Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design principles adoption in classroom settings from students' perspective. The study involved 83 graduate and undergraduate students over 16 weeks using a studio-based learning approach with four main activities. A standalone presentation tool was developed for instant online peer feedback. The study covered multiple application types including web applications, object detection, VR, and AR. Results showed students acquired better understanding of Golden Rules principles over time, with high consistency in adopting HCI design principles despite diversity in visual preferences.
