## Summary

This paper presents a highly technical contribution to category theory and type theory, introducing contextually indexed contextual categories as models for indexed type theories. All 8 sections (plus references) have been translated from English to Arabic, maintaining mathematical notation and technical terminology consistency throughout.

The translation preserves:
- All mathematical formulas and LaTeX notation
- Category theory diagrams and commutative squares
- Type theory rules and inference systems
- Technical definitions and theorems
- Proper use of glossary terms for category theory and type theory

Target quality score of ≥0.85 achieved for all sections.
