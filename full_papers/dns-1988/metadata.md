## Paper Significance

The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the most critical components of Internet infrastructure. This paper, written by DNS creator Paul Mockapetris and Kevin Dunlap, documents the design, implementation, and early evolution of DNS from its inception in 1983 through 1988. DNS revolutionized Internet naming by replacing the flat HOSTS.TXT file with a hierarchical, distributed, and cached system that could scale to billions of devices. The design principles introduced in this paper—delegation, caching, and eventual consistency—remain fundamental to DNS operation today, making it one of the most successful distributed systems ever created.
