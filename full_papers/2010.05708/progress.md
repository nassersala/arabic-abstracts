## Challenges Encountered
1. **Long sections with subsections:** Section 2 (Challenges) had multiple subsections with personal statements requiring careful organization
2. **Personal voices:** Maintained distinct author voices (mf, jd, sk, pk, cd, ac, ns, po, mr, rz) in translations
3. **Technical vs. pedagogical terms:** Balanced formal methods terminology with educational concepts
4. **Cultural adaptation:** Adapted examples while maintaining Western context (e.g., Chromium, AlphaZero)
5. **Length management:** Efficiently handled 26-page paper with comprehensive sections

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ Back-translation verification for key paragraphs
