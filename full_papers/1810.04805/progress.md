## Challenges & Solutions

None yet - just started!

## Timeline

- **2025-11-14**: Project setup, structure identification
- **Target Completion**: TBD (estimated 3-5 sessions)

## Next Steps

1. Copy abstract from translations/1810.04805.md to 00-abstract.md
2. Load glossary.md for consistent terminology
3. Start with Section 1: Introduction (highest priority)
4. Continue with Section 2: Related Work
5. Progress through remaining sections sequentially
