## Summary

Successfully translated all 6 sections of "The Semantics of Rank Polymorphism" paper. All sections meet or exceed the minimum quality threshold of 0.85. The translation preserves:

- ✅ All mathematical notation and formal definitions
- ✅ Complete formal grammar (BNF syntax)
- ✅ Type inference rules and judgments
- ✅ Reduction rules for operational semantics
- ✅ Formal proofs (Progress and Preservation lemmas)
- ✅ All citations and references
- ✅ Technical terminology consistency using glossary
- ✅ Code examples in Remora syntax

## Key Technical Terms Established

- Rank polymorphism: تعدد الأشكال حسب الرتبة
- Type indices: مؤشرات الأنواع
- Dependent product: منتج معتمد
- Dependent sum: مجموع معتمد
- Box: صندوق
- Cell: خلية
- Frame: إطار
- Lifting: الرفع
- Type erasure: محو الأنواع
- Bisimulation: المحاكاة الثنائية

## Translation Approach

Each section includes:
1. English version (complete for context)
2. Arabic translation (النسخة العربية)
3. Translation notes (figures, equations, citations, special handling)
4. Quality metrics breakdown
5. Back-translation validation of key paragraphs

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Formalism Section:** Extremely technical with ~9000 words of formal definitions, type rules, and proofs. Required careful preservation of all mathematical notation while providing accurate Arabic explanations.

2. **Mathematical Notation:** All formal notation (BNF grammars, type judgments, reduction rules) preserved exactly as in original, with Arabic explanatory text provided.

3. **Technical Terminology:** Maintained consistency across all sections using the glossary, introducing new terms where necessary.
