## Historical Significance

This paper is one of the most foundational works in computer science and mathematical logic. It introduced:

1. **The Turing Machine**: A mathematical model of computation that defines what it means for a function to be computable
2. **Computable Numbers**: A rigorous definition of numbers whose decimal expansions can be calculated by finite means
3. **The Universal Machine**: The concept of a single machine that can simulate any other computing machine (precursor to modern general-purpose computers)
4. **Proof of Undecidability**: Demonstrated that the Halting Problem is undecidable, proving that there are well-defined mathematical problems that cannot be solved algorithmically
5. **Solution to the Entscheidungsproblem**: Proved that Hilbert's decision problem has no solution
