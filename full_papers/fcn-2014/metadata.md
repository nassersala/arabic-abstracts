## Paper Overview

This seminal paper introduces fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for semantic segmentation, demonstrating that convolutional networks can be trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels for semantic segmentation. The key contributions include:

1. Adapting contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks
2. Introducing skip connections to combine semantic information from deep layers with appearance information from shallow layers
3. Achieving state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC, NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow datasets
4. Fast inference (1/3 second for typical image)

This work has been highly influential in computer vision, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.
