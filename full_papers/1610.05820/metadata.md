## Paper Impact

This is a seminal work in ML privacy and security that:
- Introduced the first systematic membership inference attack against ML models
- Demonstrated privacy vulnerabilities in commercial ML services (Google, Amazon)
- Established the foundation for understanding privacy leakage in ML
- Highly cited (5000+ citations) foundational work in ML privacy
