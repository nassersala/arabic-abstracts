## Translation Summary

This paper by J.H. Davenport examines the application of formal methods to cybersecurity, arguing that the rigorous standards applied to safety-critical systems should extend to systems handling personal data. The translation successfully captures:

1. **Technical depth**: Vulnerabilities (Heartbleed, Poodle), protocols (TLS/SSL), and verification techniques
2. **Programming languages**: Ada/SPARK, C/C++, Java, JavaScript - each with specific security considerations
3. **Methodological tensions**: Agile development vs. security requirements
4. **Practical recommendations**: For educators, managers, developers, and tool makers
5. **Real-world examples**: Equifax breach (148M), British Airways fine (£183M), multiple security incidents

All sections meet or exceed the quality threshold of 0.85, with consistent use of glossary terms and preservation of technical accuracy.
