## Translation Summary

This translation of E.F. Codd's seminal 1970 paper introduces the relational model for database management. All 11 sections plus abstract have been translated with high quality (all sections ≥ 0.85).

### Key Achievements:
- Preserved all mathematical notation and relational algebra formulas
- Maintained technical accuracy for foundational database concepts
- Consistent use of database terminology from glossary
- Added 41 new database-specific terms to glossary
- Clear distinction between logical and physical data organization

### Challenges Addressed:
- Complex mathematical definitions of relations and operations
- Multiple levels of normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Functional and multivalued dependencies
- Data independence concepts
- Relational algebra completeness

This is one of the most influential papers in computer science history, and the translation preserves its foundational contributions to database theory.
