## Paper Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in computer science history. It introduced the relational model for database management, which became the foundation for modern database systems including SQL databases. The paper introduced fundamental concepts including:

- n-ary relations as the basis for data organization
- Normal forms for data consistency
- Relational algebra operations
- Data independence principle
- Universal data sublanguage concept

The paper revolutionized how databases are designed and implemented, moving away from hierarchical and network models to the more flexible relational approach.
