\subsection{Background: Theorem Proving for CASL}
With respect to \CASL and \ModalCASL, tool support comes in the form
of \Hets~\cite{hets07}, the Heterogeneous Tool Set. \Hets supports
parsing (is the specification correct w.r.t.\ the context-free
grammar?) and static analysis (is the specification correct
w.r.t.\ context-sensitive properties, such as: have all sorts occurring
in a formula been declared?) of specifications written in \CASL and
\ModalCASL. \Hets also acts as a broker to various proof assistants
and automated theorem provers that can be called to discharge
proofs. We mainly make use of \SPASS~\cite{weidenbach02} and of
eProver~\cite{schulz02} both of which support theorem proving for
first-order logic with equality. At this point, we note that in our
experience with our models, both these theorem provers work best with
smaller axiomatic bases. Hence whenever possible, we make our
specifications as loose as possible by systematically excluding axioms
that are not required for a given proof.
