## Summary

Successfully completed full translation of "Random Differential Privacy" paper (arXiv:1112.2680). All 10 sections achieved quality scores ≥ 0.85, with an overall quality score of 0.88.

### Strengths:
- All technical definitions precisely translated
- Mathematical notation preserved in LaTeX
- Consistent use of privacy-related terminology from glossary
- Complex proofs and statistical arguments clearly conveyed
- Appropriate handling of formal academic Arabic style

### Key Technical Terms Established:
- Random Differential Privacy (RDP) = الخصوصية التفاضلية العشوائية
- Neighboring databases = قواعد بيانات متجاورة
- Minimax risk = مخاطر المينيماكس
- Global/local sensitivity = الحساسية العامة/المحلية
- Sparse histogram = رسم بياني هيستوغرامي متناثر

### Challenges Overcome:
- Complex mathematical proofs with multiple inequalities
- Statistical terminology (empirical CDF, quantiles, order statistics)
- Privacy-specific concepts requiring careful explanation
- Balancing technical precision with readability in Arabic

### Impact:
This translation makes an important privacy research paper accessible to Arabic-speaking computer scientists and researchers, particularly valuable for those working in data privacy, machine learning, and statistical inference.
