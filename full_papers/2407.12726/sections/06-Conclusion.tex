\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We successfully implemented \QC in \iidris and demonstrated how it can be
extended to generate arbitrary instances of dependent types. We then highlighted
how dependent types allow us to model stateful systems, that these models are
tricky to get right, and how we can use \QC at the type-level to automatically
detect this and help us fix it. Finally, we generalised the type-level framework
to support any stateful system, and demonstrated its usefulness by modelling,
implementing, and testing a network protocol. Our approach is not a proof
system, however it should help prototype specifications and models faster,
gaining confidence that the current system is sound, before potentially choosing
to model check or to formalise and prove it. We believe that our generalisation
is low-friction enough for wider adoption and are excited to see what this may
lead to.
