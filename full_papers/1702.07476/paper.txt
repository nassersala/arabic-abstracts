  The most salient feature of the bound is its (often non-
monotone) dependency on α: as α approaches 1, Dα (P kQ)
shrinks (by monotonicity of the Rényi divergence) but the
power to which it is raised goes to 0, pushing the result in the
opposite direction. Several our proofs proceed by finding the
optimal, or approximately optimal, α minimizing the bound.
  The Rényi divergence is not a metric: it is not symmetric
and it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. A weaker variant
of the triangle inequality tying together the Rényi divergence
of different orders does hold. Its general version is presented
below.
Proposition 11 (Weak triangle inequality). Let P, Q, R be
distributions on R. Then for α > 1 and for any p, q > 1
satisfying 1/p + 1/q = 1 it holds that
                   α − 1/p
     Dα (P kQ) ≤           Dpα (P kR) + Dq(α−1/p) (RkQ).
                    α−1
