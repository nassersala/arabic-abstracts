## Paper Significance

This paper addresses a critical challenge in formal methods adoption: the difficulty of eliciting formal specifications from domain experts who lack formal logic training. ViSpec provides a graphical interface that enables non-experts to develop formal specifications that are automatically translated to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL).

Key contributions:
- Graphical formalism for specification development accessible to non-experts
- Automatic translation from graphical specifications to MTL
- Usability study demonstrating effectiveness with academic and industry practitioners
- Applications in robotic systems including robotic surgery and autonomous quadcopters
- High accuracy in formal requirement definition
