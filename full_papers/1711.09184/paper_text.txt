A Formal Speciﬁcation Framework for Smart Grid
Components
Waseem Akram, and Muaz Niazi, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract —Smart grid can be considered as the next step in the
evolution of power systems. It comprises of different entities and
objects ranging from smart appliances, smart meters, generators,
smart storages, and more. One key problem in modeling smart
grid is that while currently there is a considerable focus on the
practical aspects of smart grid, there are very few modeling
attempts and even lesser attempts at formalization. To the best of
our knowledge, among other formal methods, formal speciﬁcation
has previously not been applied in the domain of smart grid. In
this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by presenting a novel
approach to modeling smart grid components using a formal
speciﬁcation approach. We use a state-based formal speciﬁcation
language namely Z (pronounced as ‘Zed’) since we believe Z
is particularly suited for modeling smart grid components.We
demonstrate the application of Z on key smart grid components.
The presented formal speciﬁcation can be considered as ﬁrst steps
towards modeling of smart grid using a Software Engineering
formalism. It also demonstrates how complex systems, such as the
smart grid, can be modeled elegantly using formal speciﬁcation.

Adaptive System
I. I NTRODUCTION
A smart grid can be considered as an advanced and radically
evolved version of traditional power systems. The term ’smart’
in the smart grid exempliﬁes the use of bi-directional com-
munication, artiﬁcial intelligence, Complex systems theory,
modeling and simulation, and more, all employed with the
goal of converting the legacy power grid into an advanced
proactive and reactive system. At the lowest level however, the
Smart grid can be considered as an integrated system made up
of a variety of interacting components - ranging from smart
appliances and smart storages to smart generators, Internet of
Things (IoT), and beyond. Another key focus of the Smart
grid is in the integration of renewable energy resources, such
as, but not limited to, wind turbines and solar panels [1]. By
integrating advanced communication and information systems,
Smart grid components can communicate and coordinate with
each other with the goal of constructing a sustainable and
efﬁcient energy production system [2] for the future.
As the size of smart grid increases, however, it is coupled
with an increase in its intrinsic complexity [3]. Smart grid
implies complexity[4]. To understand this complexity, it is
necessary to ponder on the fact that, in any modern large-
scale power system, each component can itself be dynamic
in its very nature. As such, the states of the system, which
are a function of and the result of emergent properties of the
numerous interacting components, can also vary temporally.
The result of what we see at the macro-level cannot thus be
Corresponding author muaz.niazi@ieee.orgeasily discernible as a direct function of the micro-level. This
behavior can thus be considered as the outcome of numerous
interactive events occurring in relation to each component -
quite similar to a natural Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
[5]. With so much complexity at hand, it is clear that modeling
the smart grid certainly needs considerable number of practical
examples and case studies [6]. It is also evident that developing
various types of formalisms for the domain is needed. This will
allow for the selection of better and more elegant solution
to models - which in turn can be used to develop a better
understanding of the complex domain. Essentially, modeling
any system can be considered as an activity which allows
for a better understanding of the system. In the smart grid
domain, better modeling approaches can not only simplify
system complexity but also allow for a better understanding
and implementation of the system. Besides, it can also allow
for ensuring a reduction in system failures.
Formal methods provide facilities for the modeling of each
component of any complex system [7]. It allows for developing
models for each component of the system allowing for a
clear focus on understanding consistency as well as semantic
correctness. The behavior of each system can be analyzed
and observed with the help of these formal models. A key
beneﬁt to this approach is that it helps in the detection of
faults and ﬂaws in the design phase of system development,
thereby considerably improving system reliability.
In previous studies, formal speciﬁcation framework has
been successfully applied for the mathematical modeling of
different CAS ranging across various domains. Some key
examples of such work includes a formal speciﬁcation used for
the modeling of AIDS spread using agent-based modeling [8].
Likewise, it has been developed for modeling the progression
of researchers in their domain [9], and for the modeling of
wireless sensor networks [10]. The use of formal speciﬁcation
models for modeling CAS also include studies such as [11],
[12]. Suggestions to use formal speciﬁcation for the Smart
grid have also previously been mentioned in literature [13].
Another example is the use of state machine formalism [14].
However, to the best of our knowledge, the same approach has
not been applied much in the domain of the smart grid domain.
It is thus clear that there is a growing need to model the key
components in a smart grid by means of an elegant formal
framework among other tools such as noted previously [15].
Such a prudent approach allows for a better understanding of
the domain besides allowing for systems to be veriﬁed using
the given speciﬁcation.
In this paper, we present ﬁrst steps towards a basic formal
speciﬁcation modeling framework for smart grid components.
We ﬁrst consider different types of entities and then elaboratearXiv:1711.09184v1  [cs.LO]  25 Nov 2017

their detailed formal speciﬁcations.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2
provides basic concept of a formal framework and a smart grid
scenario is discussed. Section 3 presents formal speciﬁcation
of different entities of smart grid system. The paper ends with
a conclusion in section 4.
II. T HEORETICAL FOUNDATION
In this section, we present the theoretical foundations
needed for understand the presented formal speciﬁcation
model.
A. Formal Frameworks
A formal speciﬁcation is a software engineering approach
that is used for mathematical modeling of different compo-
nents of a system [7]. During engineering of any system,
it is important to ensure that all the system components
are integrated and working correctly without any error. A
formal speciﬁcation provides this facility to accurately specify
each requirement of the system before going to the real
implementation [16].
A formal speciﬁcation decomposes the large system into the
subsystem. Then provides a speciﬁcation for each individual
subsystems. It follows two approaches; one is the algebraic
approach in which each operation and relationships can be
described, second is a model-based approach which concerns
with the state and transitions of each individual components.
The model-based approach uses the Z language speciﬁcation
which involves the utilization of mathematical notations, sets,
sequences, and states [17].
B. Scenario of the Smart grid
We can think of a smart grid as a complex system in
which different consumers and generation units are connected
through power communication lines [18]. Generation units
generate power and transmit toward consumer’s side. Con-
sumers demand energy according to their usage proﬁle and
generation units response according to the consumer’s demand
[19].
On the consumer’s side, the process of monitoring and
controlling consumer’s demand energy usage proﬁle is called
home energy management (HEM) [20]. This process involves
the use of smart meters, smart appliances, information and
communication technology etc. the smart meters collect data
about consumer’s demand at the different time period and
transmit this collected data to the power generation unit. On
the power generation unit side, this data is analyzed and
response according to the consumer’s demand. Sometimes,
consumer’s demands exceed from available energy power at
the grid side. This creates unbalance situation of the power
system. To handle this issue, the concept of demand response
management (DRM)[21] has been introduced.
DRM is the process of adjusting consumer’s demand in
response to the price of energy and incentives from grid side.
The generation unit sends their energy cost pattern of different
time periods. The time in which power cost is high is calledhigh peak hour and the time in which power cost is low is
called off peak hour. So during high peak hour, consumers
can keep their ﬂexible appliances off and run at low peak
hour.
To reduce burden on generation unit, the concept of renew-
able energy sources (RES) is also introduced in a smart grid
application [22]. RES can be in the form of photo-voltaic (PV)
or wind energy sources. These energy sources can be installed
and provide energy to the consumer’s side. Consumers can
use this energy at an off-peak hour, so this solves the energy
unbalance as well as high-cost issues. The energy collected
from RES can be stored using storage devices. Sometimes, if
the available energy is larger than consumer’s demands, then
it can be sold back to the grid unit by using some buyback
mechanism [23]. However, RES has unpredictable nature and
depends on weather and time. PV energy can only be produced
during the daytime i.e. at sunny day. Wind energy can only
be produced in windy environments.
Regarding RES, a new concept has also been included in
a smart grid called electric vehicles (EVs) [24]. These EVs
are using energy storage devices which can be charged either
using PV or electric station. The stored energy is then used
for drive vehicles. In case if the energy demands of consumers
exceed at grid unit. These EVs can also provide energy to the
grid unit by using the vehicle to grid (V2G) mechanism.
III. F ORMAL SPECIFICATION FRAMEWORK
In this section, we present formal speciﬁcation models for
the smart grid components. In our study, we consider four
different entities in a smart grid system. These entities are:
appliance, solar, turbine, and storage devices. Each entity has
different states as well as associated events that cause state
transitions. In table I, summary of each object, states and
events are given.
A. Smart appliance
An appliance object has three distinct states along with
events associated with states. As we can see in ﬁgure 1,
Whenever an unplugged event occurs, the appliance enters
in the disconnected state. By plugged-in event, the appliance
enters in the connected state. And whenever an in-use event
occurs, the appliance remains in the running state.
Next, we present formal speciﬁcation for an appliance
object.
A free type “APPLIANCESTATE” is used to represent dif-
ferent states of an appliance that are disconnected, connected
and running.
[APPLIANCESTATE ] == fdisconnected ;connected ;running g
Next, we deﬁne an appliance schema that contains “appState”
variable of type “APPLIANCESTATE”. The value of “app-
State” can be either disconnected, connected or running.
Appliance
appState :APPLIANCESTATE
As we have deﬁned appliance state and appliance schema.
Now we can move towards operational schemas.

TABLE I: Smart grid components, their states and events
Object States Events
ApplianceDisconnected Unplugged
Connected Plugged-in, not in-use
Running In use
TurbineNot running No wind
Slow running Slow wind
Fast running Fast wind
SolarNo energy generation Night time
Partial energy generation Day, cloudy
Full energy generation Day, sunny
StorageCharging Store energy
Discharging Consume energy
Not-in-use remove storage
First, we start by presenting initialization schema named as
InitAppliance . In this schema, we declare “Appliance” schema
as a variable. In predicate section, we say that on initialization,
the state of an appliance must be equal to disconnected.
InitAppliance
Appliance
appState =disconnected
As the plugged-in event occurs, the state of an appliance
becomes connected. To show this transition, we deﬁne an
operational schema called PluggedInAppliance . In the schema,
the changing state of an appliance is shown by a delta sign ().
In predicate, we say that the state of an appliance is changed
from disconnected to the connected state.
PluggedInAppliance
Appliance
appState =disconnected
appState0=connected
The state of an appliance is also changing whenever an in-
use event occurs. Then the appliance remains in a running
state. This transition is shown by deﬁning InUseAppliance .
Here, again we declare the changing state of an appliance
with a delta sign. In predicate, ﬁrst an appliance must be in
the connected state, then we say that the state changes to the
running state.
InUseAppliance
Appliance
appState =connected
appState0=running
As we noted before, when an unplugged event occurs, an
appliance goes to the disconnected state. This transition is
shown by another schema called UnPluggedAppliance . In the
predicate section, we can see that the state of an appliance
changes from connected to the disconnected state.
UnPluggedAppliance
Appliance
appState =connected
appState0=disconnectedAn appliance can be in connected but not in use state. This
operation is shown by introducing another schema called
NotInUseAppliance .
NotInUseAppliance
Appliance
appState =running
appState0=connected
There can be some scenario in which a schema can be suc-
cess or there may some error. To understanding the success and
error conditions of schemas, we present free type deﬁnitions
in the form of table II. In the given table, for each schema we
deﬁne the success and failure conditions.
B. Wind turbine system
A wind turbine object has three distinct states named as
turbine not running, turbine slow running, and turbine fast
running. There are also different events associated with each
state that causes a state transition. In ﬁgure 2 we can see that
when there is no wind, the turbine enters in the “Turbine not
running” state. When there is slow wind, turbine runs slowly.
And if there is fast wind, the turbine is running fast.

Next, we present formal speciﬁcation for a turbine object.
First, we start by deﬁning a free type “TURBINESTATE”
set. This set comprises of a turbine different states that
are “turbineNotRunning, turbineSlowRunning, and turbineFas-
tRunning”.
[TURBINESTATE ] == ftrubineNotRunning ;
turbineSlowRunning ;turbineFastRunning g
Now, we deﬁne a wind turbine system schema by presenting
WindTurbine . This schema consists of a variable “trbState” of
type TURBINESTATE . The value of this variable can be either
“turbineNotRunning”, “turbineSlowRunning”, or “turbineFas-
tRunning”.
WindTurbine
trbState :TURBINESTATE
As we have deﬁned turbine’s states and turbine’s schema, now
we move to operational schemas.
First, we start by initializing a turbine entity by presenting
InitTurbine schema. In the schema, ﬁrst, we call the Wind-
Fig. 2: Wind turbine lifetime
Turbine schema. Then in the predicate, we say that the initial
state of a turbine must be equal to “turbineNotRunning” state.
InitTurbine
WindTurbine
trbState =turbineNotRunning
As we noted in the state diagram when during slow wind,
the state of a turbine becomes “turbineSlowRunning”. This
transition is shown by deﬁning SlowWind schema. In the
schema, we call the WindTurbine schema with a delta sign.
In predicate, we say that the state of a turbine is changing
from “turbineNotRunning” to the “turbineSlowRunning”.
SlowWind
WindTurbine
trbState =turbineNotRunning
trbState0=turbineSlowRunning
--- PAGE 5 ---

In case of fast wind, a turbine runs fast. To show this process,
we present another schema called FastWind . In the schema,
again we call WindTurbine schema with a delta sign. In
predicate, we say that the state of a turbine changes from
slow to fast running.
FastWind
WindTurbine
trbState =turbineSlowRunning
trbState0=turbineFastRunning
A turbine’s state also changes to not running when there
is no wind. This transition is shown by introducing NoWind
schema. The schema shows that a turbine’s state is changed
from slow running to not running state.
NoWind
WindTurbine
trbState =turbineSlowRunning
trbState0=turbineNotRunning
The schemas of the turbine entity can be success or fail
when errors occur. So to understand the success and error
conditions of each turbine’s schemas, we present free type
deﬁnitions in table III.
C. Solar system
A solar object has three distinct states named as “no
energy generation, partial energy generation, and full energy
generation”. There are also different events associated with
each state that causes a state transition. The states and it’s
associated events have shown in the ﬁgure 3. Next, we present
formal speciﬁcation for a solar object.
First, we begin by introducing a free type “SOLARSTATE”
that is used for presenting different states of a solar entity. This
set comprises of “noEnergyGeneration, partialEnergyGenera-
tion, and fullEnergyGeneration” states.
[SOLARSTATE ] == fnoEnergyGeneration ;
partialEnergyGeneration ;fullEnergyGeneration g
Here, we present a solar system by introducing SolarPanel
schema. The schema takes a variable “slrState” of type SO-
LARSTATE . The value of this variable can be either “noEner-
gyGenreation”, “partialEnergyGeneration” or “fullEnergyGen-
eration”.
SolarPanel
slrState :SOLARSTATE
As we have deﬁned solar state and schema, now we move
towards the operational schemas.
The initialization process is shown by presenting InitSolar
schema. First, the schema calls the SolarPanel schema in the
declaration part. In predicate, we deﬁned that the state of a
solar is “noEnergyGeneration” at the initial time.
Fig. 3: A solar lifetime
InitSolar
SolarPanel
slrState =noEnergyGeneration
As we know that when there is a cloud at daytime, then
the solar generates partial energy. During this time period,
the solar remains in a partial energy generation state. This
process is shown by introducing DayAndCloudy schema. In
the schema, the changing state of a solar is shown by a delta
sign. In predicate, it shows that the state of solar changes from
no generation to the partial generation.
DayAndCloudy
SolarPanel
slrState =noEnergyGeneration
slrState0=partialEnergyGeneration
In case of the sunny day, a solar remains in a full genera-
tion state. This process is shown by deﬁning DayAndSunny
schema. Here, we again deﬁne the changing state of a solar
with delta sign. In predicate, we say that the state of solar
changes from partial to full energy generation.
DayAndSunny
SolarPanel
slrState =partialEnergyGeneration
slrState0=fullEnergyGeneration
As we know that a solar does not generate any energy during
night time. At this time period, solar remains in a no generation

trbState =turbineFastRunning
NoWindTurbine is running slowly
trbState =turbineSlowRunningAlready in not running state
trbState =turbineNotRunning
state. Here, we present another schema called “Night”. In the
schema, we say that the current state of a solar can be partial
or full energy generation. Then we change solar state to the
no energy generation state.
Night
SolarPanel
slrState =partialEnergyGeneration _fullEnergyGeneration
slrState0=noEnergyGeneration
The success and failure conditions for the solar’s schemas
is summarized in table IV.
D. Storage system
A storage device also has different states as well as events
that cause the transition of states. As we can see in the ﬁgure 4
that there are three states named as “charging, discharging, and
not in use” of a storage object. When a store energy or battery
low event occurs, the storage enters in the charging state.
In case of energy consumption, the state of storage becomes
discharging, In case remove event, the state of storage becomes
not in use.
Next, we present formal speciﬁcation for a storage system.
First, we start by deﬁning a free type STORAGESTATE set
that comprises of different state of a storage device.
[STORAGESTATE ] == fcharging ;discharging ;notInUse g
Here, we deﬁne a storage system schema. In the schema, we
declare a variable “strState” of type STORAGESTATE that has
any single value from the storage state set.
StorageDevice
strState :STORAGESTATE
As we have deﬁned storage state and system schema. Now,
we move towards operational schema.
First, we start by introducing an initialization schema called
InitSorage . This schema calls the StorageDevice schema as a
variable. In predicate, it shows that the state of a storage is
“notInUse” at the initial time.
InitStorage
StorageDevice
strState =notInUse
As we noted before, when a store energy event occurs, a
storage goes to the charging state. This process is shown by
StoreEnergy schema. The changing of a storage is shown by
a delta sign. In predicate, it shows that the current state of
Fig. 4: A storage lifetime
a storage is “notInUse” which is changed to the “charging”
state.
StoreEnergy
StorageDevice
strState =notInUse
strState0=charging
We also know that when a consume energy event occurs, a
storage device goes to the discharging state. This process is
shown by presenting ConsumeEnergy schema. In the schema,
we can see that the state of a storage changes from charging
to the discharging state.
ConsumeEnergy
StorageDevice
strState =charging
strState0=discharging
A storage can also enter in the charging state whenever the
storage state is low. This process is presented by means of
BatteryLow schema.

slrState =

slrState =

BatteryLow
StorageDevice
strState =discharging
strState0=charging
When a storage is removed from the system, then it goes to
the “notInUse” state. This process is shown by introducing
another schema called RemoveStorage . In the schema, we can
see a storage can be in either charging or discharging state.
Then it’s state changes to the “notInUse” state.
RemoveStorage
StorageDevice
strState =charging _discharging
strState0=notInUse
The schemas of the storage devices can be success and may
be there some errors at the execution time. So there is also
need to deﬁne the success and error criteria for schemas. Here,
in table V, we summarized all success and failure conditions
of the storage’s schemas.
IV. C ONCLUSIONS & F UTURE WORK
In this paper, we focused on formal speciﬁcation of smart
grid components. We considered four different components of
a smart grid system. We identiﬁed states and events which
cause state transitions of each individual component. Then
we modeled each component of the smart grid system by
using a formal speciﬁcation approach. This provides a clear
understanding the behavior of each component involved in the
system. The presented formal framework clearly demonstrates
the utility of using a formal speciﬁcation approach to modeling
complex systems including technological systems such as
the smart grid. Here we would like to mention that the
presented framework currently considers only four key smart
grid components. However, the same can be further expanded
for a large number of devices. Additionally, in the future,
the work can be expanded to formally model using other
approaches such as Petri nets, among others.REFERENCES
