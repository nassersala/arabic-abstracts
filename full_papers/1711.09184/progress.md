## Summary

Successfully translated all main sections of the paper on formal specification framework for smart grid components. The paper introduces the application of Z formal specification language to model smart grid components including appliances, wind turbines, solar panels, and storage devices. All Z specification schemas are preserved in their original form (standard practice for formal methods), while explanatory text is translated to Arabic. The translation maintains technical accuracy and consistency with the glossary.
