## Translation Challenges

1. **Mathematical Logic**: Gödel's incompleteness theorem, axioms, logical underdetermination
2. **Quantum Theory**: Hilbert spaces, density operators, tensor products, entanglement
3. **Computability**: Turing machines, Choice Machines, oracles, uncountability
4. **Philosophy**: Agency, symbol handling, epistemology of physics
5. **Mathematical Proofs**: Cantor's diagonal argument, tensor product constructions

## Key Terms to Track

From glossary.md:
- theorem → نظرية
- incompleteness → عدم الاكتمال
- axiom → بديهية
- quantum theory → نظرية الكم
- agency → فاعلية
- measurement → القياس
- computation → حساب
- oracle → أوراكل
- Hilbert space → فضاء هيلبرت
- entanglement → التشابك
- density matrix → مصفوفة الكثافة
- Turing machine → آلة تورينغ (to be added to glossary)
- uncountable → غير قابل للعد (to be added to glossary)
- symbol handling → معالجة الرموز (to be added to glossary)
