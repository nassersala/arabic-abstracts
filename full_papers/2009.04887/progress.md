## Translation Notes

### Key Technical Terms
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems (نظريات عدم الاكتمال لغودل)
- G1 / First incompleteness theorem (نظرية عدم الاكتمال الأولى)
- G2 / Second incompleteness theorem (نظرية عدم الاكتمال الثانية)
- PA (Peano Arithmetic) (حساب بيانو)
- ω-consistency (اتساق ω)
- Recursively axiomatized (مبدئي بشكل عودي)
- Provability (قابلية الإثبات)
- Consistency (الاتساق)

### Challenges
1. Highly technical mathematical logic content
2. Many formal definitions and theorems
3. References to other mathematical results
4. Philosophical discussions mixed with technical content
5. Need to maintain precision while being readable in Arabic

## Translation Strategy
1. Start with abstract (copy from existing translation)
2. Translate introduction to understand paper's scope
3. Work through preliminaries carefully (establish terminology)
4. Break section 3 into subsections due to length
5. Continue with sections 4-6
6. Review and back-translate key passages
7. Update glossary with new terms
