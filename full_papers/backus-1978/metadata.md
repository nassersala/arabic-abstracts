## About This Paper

This is John Backus's 1977 ACM Turing Award Lecture, published in Communications of the ACM in August 1978. The paper presents a fundamental critique of conventional programming languages, arguing that they are constrained by the von Neumann computer architecture. Backus proposes functional programming as an alternative paradigm that liberates programming from the word-at-a-time style and provides a mathematical foundation for reasoning about programs.

The paper introduces FP (Functional Programming) systems, FFP (Formal Functional Programming) systems, and AST (Applicative State Transition) systems, along with an algebra of programs based on combining forms.
