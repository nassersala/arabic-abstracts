## Historical Significance

This is the seminal 1965 paper that introduced the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, one of the most influential algorithms in computational mathematics and signal processing. The paper has been cited over 12,000 times and revolutionized digital signal processing, communications, and scientific computing by reducing the computational complexity of Fourier series calculation from O(N²) to O(N log N).

## Paper Structure

The paper is concise (5 pages) and consists of:
1. Introduction and problem statement
2. Algorithm derivation with mathematical proofs
3. Implementation notes (binary representation, bit-reversal)
4. Application examples (difference equations)
5. Performance results (IBM 7094 computing times)
6. References (2 citations)
