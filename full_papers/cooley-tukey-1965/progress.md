## Translation Summary

This translation covers the complete Cooley-Tukey 1965 paper that introduced the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The paper is remarkably concise (5 pages) yet introduced one of the most important algorithms in computer science, reducing Fourier transform complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).

### Key Technical Terms Introduced
- عوامل الدوران (twiddle factors)
- مصفوفة قطرية كتلية (block-diagonal matrix)
- مصفوفة إبدال (permutation matrix)
- أساس (radix)
- عدد مركب بدرجة عالية (highly composite number)

### Challenges Addressed
- Mathematical notation preservation
- Complex matrix algebra terminology
- Computational complexity analysis
- Historical references to prior work
- Balancing technical precision with Arabic readability
