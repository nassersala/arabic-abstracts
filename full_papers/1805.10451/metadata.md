## Paper Summary

This paper provides a theoretical geometric perspective on deep learning using manifold theory. The authors explain that the fundamental principle behind deep learning's success is the manifold structure in data - natural high-dimensional data concentrates close to a low-dimensional manifold. The paper introduces concepts of:

1. **Rectified Linear Complexity** for DNNs to measure learning capability
2. **Rectified Linear Complexity** for embedded manifolds to describe learning difficulty
3. **Optimal Mass Transportation Theory** to control probability distributions in latent space

The work demonstrates that for any DNN with fixed architecture, there exists a manifold that cannot be learned by the network.
