Abstract Context: Ensuring safety for any sophisticated system is getting
more complex due to the rising number of features and functionalities. This
calls for formal methods to entrust condence in such systems. Nevertheless,
using formal methods in industry is demanding because of their lack of us-
ability and the diculty of understanding verication results. Objective: We
evaluate the acceptance of formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers,
particularly whether the diculty of understanding verication results can
be reduced. Method: We perform two dierent exploratory studies. First, we
conduct a user survey to explore challenges in identifying inconsistent spec-
ications and using formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers. Second,
we perform a one-group pretest-posttest experiment to collect impressions
from Bosch engineers familiar with formal methods to evaluate whether under-
standing verication results is simplied by our counterexample explanation
approach. Results: The results from the user survey indicate that identifying
renement inconsistencies, understanding formal notations, and interpreting
verication results are challenging. Nevertheless, engineers are still interested
in using formal methods in real-world development processes because it could
reduce the manual eort for verication. Additionally, they also believe formal
methods could make the system safer. Furthermore, the one-group pretest-
posttest experiment results indicate that engineers are more comfortable un-

1 Introduction
The overarching goal of formal methods is to help engineers construct more
reliable systems. { Clarke and Wing (1996)
Motivation. Research on formal methods has been continuing for more than
three decades (Bowen and Breuer 2021). Initial applications of formal methods
are introduced by Wing (1990) and Rushby (1993). In recent years, formal
methods have been developed to analyze and verify complex safety-critical
systems (Ferrari and ter Beek 2023; Kaleeswaran et al. 2022). Especially au-
tomated verication techniques based on formal methods are promising can-
didates (Baier and Katoen 2008; Grumberg and Veith 2008; Clarke et al.
2018a,b) to ensure the functional safety, for instance, of automotive systems.
Even though the use of formal methods is considered to be a promising so-
lution, industries are still hesitant to use it for real-world projects due to its
complexity (Heitmeyer 1998; Abrial 2006; Bicarregui et al. 2009; Kossak et al.
2014; Jones and Thomas 2022; Ferrari and ter Beek 2023). To adopt formal
methods in industry, usability and learnability are key factors (ter Beek et al.
2019; Reid et al. 2020). There exist several approaches that ease the use of for-
mal methods. For example, property specication patterns (Dwyer et al. 1999;
Konrad and Cheng 2005; Grunske 2008; Post and Hoenicke 2012; Autili et al.
2015) and structured natural language (Giannakopoulou et al. 2020) are con-
venient means to specify requirements to be translated into a temporal logic.
Furthermore, the tools by Ratiu et al. (2021), Gerking et al. (2015), and Bar-
bon et al. (2019) support performing verication in integration with a model
checker. In a recent survey, we provide an overview of the state of the art in
research on explaining counterexamples and how engineers are supported in
interpreting counterexamples (Kaleeswaran et al. 2022).
With this work, we want to identify challenges and opinions on using for-
mal methods in a concrete industrial setting, which is the identication of in-
consistent specications of safety-critical automotive systems at Bosch. With
the rising number of features and functionalities, ensuring safety of such sys-
tems is a complex task that can be supported by formal methods such as
model checking. However, adopting formal methods in industry is demanding
because of lack of usability and the diculty of understanding verication re-
sults obtained by model checkers. Therefore, we want to investigate whether a
concrete approach to counterexample explanation eases the understanding of
verication results, thus helping Bosch engineers in their daily work to specify
and verify their specications of safety-critical automotive systems.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 3
Contributions. In this work, we present the results obtained from two dier-
ent user studies with Bosch automotive engineers: ( Part 1 )user survey and
(Part 2 )one-group pretest-posttest experiment . 41 participants had taken part
in the user survey and 13 participants in the one-group pretest-posttest exper-
iment . From the user survey , we rst collect challenges on identifying incon-
sistent specications and concrete inconsistencies in a specication, and on
maintaining renement consistency between components. We further collect
feedback and opinions in using formal methods. The results of the user survey
are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively.
Formal methods are not completely new to Bosch. They are used to de-
ne requirements as pattern-based specications to support verication during
product development (Post et al. 2012; Post and Hoenicke 2012). Addition-
ally, we have presented a counterexample explanation approach that attempts
to ease the use of formal methods by reducing the manual work and diculty of
interpreting the verication results generated by model checkers (Kaleeswaran
et al. 2020). Thus, the motive of the one-group pretest-posttest experiment is
to evaluate our counterexample explanation approach in an industrial setting
at Bosch. Particularly, we investigate whether explaining a counterexample
generated by a model checker in an understandable format would increase the
use of formal methods among Bosch engineers.
We pre-registered our studies (Part 1 and 2) by a report submitted to and
accepted by the Registered Reports Track at the International Conference
on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) 20211(Kaleeswaran et al.
2021). Both studies have been conducted following the same research protocol
as described in the registered report (Kaleeswaran et al. 2021) without any
modication to the design of the studies.
Outline. We introduce the background and terminology in Section 2, and dis-
cuss related user studies concerning formal methods in Section 3. We provide
an overview of the counterexample explanation approach in Section 4. In Sec-
tion 5, we outline the research questions, the design, execution plan, target
participants, and analysis plan of the studies. We present the results of the
user survey andone-group pretest-posttest experiment in Sections 6 and 7, and
discuss and interpret them in Section 8. Threats to validity are discussed in
Section 9. Finally, we conclude and outline the future work in Section 10.
Summary of results. From the results of the user survey, we found out that
understanding formal notations (Section 6.2), identifying inconsistent spec-
ications and understanding inconsistencies (Section 6.3), as well as main-
taining the consistency of rened specications and verifying the renement
consistency (Section 6.4) to be dicult for engineers. Further, the majority of
participants answered positively that formal verication could support safety
analysis and make a system safer (Section 6.5), formal methods are potential

candidates to use in the real-world development process, and usage of formal
methods could be increased by improving understanding of formal notations
(Section 6.6).
From the results of the one-group pretest-posttest experiment, we found
that participants obtain a good understanding of the inconsistencies with our
proposed counterexample explanation (Sections 7.4 and 7.5) Further, ana-
lyzing the feedback from the participants, the majority of them nd that the
counterexample explanation provides a better and quicker understanding than
the counterexample generated by the model checker (Sections 7.6{7.8).
2 Background and Terminology
In this section, we introduce the background and terminology of formal meth-
ods, model checking, contract-based design, which are relevant for our studies.
Formal methods. By formal methods we refer to models, e. g., SysML (Frieden-
thal et al. 2014), and Kripke structures used as input to verication tools
(McMillan 1999), formal specications of requirements, e. g., expressed in nat-
ural language-like statements using property specication patterns (Dwyer
et al. 1999), or directly in a temporal logic such as Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) (Pnueli 1977), and to automated tools to perform the verication. Ex-
amples of such tools are model checkers, e. g., NuSMV (Cimatti et al. 2000),
theorem provers, e. g., Isabelle (Paulson 1994), and solvers, e. g., Z3 (de Moura
and Bjrner 2008).
Model checking. Considering the verication as a model checking problem, a
specication is expressed in a temporal logic ( ) and a system is modeled as
a Kripke structure ( K). Both are the input for a model checker. The model
checker veries whether the given system model ( K) satises the given property
or specication (), that is,K(Baier and Katoen 2008; Clarke et al.
2018a). Ifis not satised by K, the model checker generates a counterexample
describing an execution path in Kthat leads from the initial system state to a
state that violates , where each state consists of system variables with their
values. Based on the counterexample, a user can manually localize the fault
inKthat causes the violation of .
Contract-based design. Contract-based design (CBD) (Cimatti and Tonetta
2012; Kaiser et al. 2015) supports the automated verication of renement con-
sistency and correctness. In CBD, model checking is used to identify whether
the top-level requirements of a system are consistently rened along the rene-
ment of the system to components. Each component of a system is associated
with a contract that precisely species the expected behavior of the compo-
nent by assumptions, and the provided behavior by guarantees. If a component
is rened to sub-components, its contract is also rened and assigned to its
sub-components. Thus, all of the sub-components should satisfy the expectedA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 5
behavior of the parent component. This corresponds to the correctness of the
rened contracts and can be veried by model checking, which is known as
therenement check (Cimatti and Tonetta 2012).
3 Related Work
In the following, we discuss existing user surveys focusing on formal methods.
Interviews with users of formal methods are conducted by Snook and Harri-
son (2001) to collect the impact on using formal methods on the company,
products, and the development process. Furthermore, the interviews focus on
various software engineering aspects such as scalability, understandability, and
tool support. Rodrigues et al. (2018) perform a survey with 20 participants
who use formal specications to solve limitations of informal specications.
Khazeev et al. (2019) conduct a survey with the students of the Software En-
gineering program to examine the AutoProof tool and highlight the challenges
associated with formal approaches.
There exists several surveys focusing mainly on particular application do-
mains. Davis et al. (2013) conduct a survey with 31 participants in the aerospace
domain. The survey collects barriers in using formal methods and also propose
mitigation measures for the identied barriers. The studies by Ferrari et al.
(2019) and ter Beek et al. (2019) focus on the railway domain. Ferrari et al.
(2019) summarizes results that are suitable for system modelling and veri-
cation from surveying 114 primary studies, 44 participants from academia and
industry, and eight projects. Similarly, ter Beek et al. (2019) collect the opinion
of users on adopting formal methods in the same domain.
According to the recent user study by Gleirscher and Marmsoler (2020)
performed with 216 participants, the participants are inclined to use formal
methods when sucient training and tool support is available. They also
present a systematic map of 35 existing studies that summarizes the opinions
of the studies' authors on formal methods, as well as the motivation, research
method, and results of the studies. Similarly, the study performed by Garavel
et al. (2020) with 130 participants focus mainly on the use of formal methods
in research, industry, and education in the past and present. Furthermore, the
study summarizes the future direction of formal methods in industry, future
target audience using formal methods, domains in which formal methods may
have an impact, and competitive or alternative methods to formal methods.
In contrast to these studies, (1) we particularly focus on identifying chal-
lenges that engineers face in identifying inconsistent specications rather than
general challenges of using formal methods, and (2) we conduct the study with
engineers who work on real-world projects in the automotive domain.
4 Counterexample Explanation in a Nutshell
Contract-based design (CBD) (Cimatti and Tonetta 2012) is a scalable solution
to overcome a manual analysis by automatically and compositionally verifying6 Kaleeswaran et al.
the consistency of system and requirement renements using model checking.
Thus, CBD provides assurances for consistent renements early in the de-
velopment process, which promises to ease corresponding testing activities at
later stages. However, using such a formal method in industry is challenging
due to usability issues, e. g., the diculty of understanding model checking
results. Thus, we have proposed a counterexample explanation approach that
eases the error comprehension of engineers|especially of non-experts in formal
methods|if the renement check fails. The approach generates a user-friendly
explanation that localizes the fault at the levels of requirements and compo-
nents. Examples of a CBD and explanations of counterexamples will be given
in the context of the study in Section 7.
The counterexample explanation approach comprises of six steps illustrated
in Figure 1. Steps 1○and 6○are performed manually while the other steps
are completely automated. Step 1○is the translation of CBD by importing
SysML models from Rhapsody and DNG requirements into FASTEN (Ratiu
et al. 2021). FASTEN is an open-source platform to experiment with rigorous
modeling of safety-critical systems. Translating the (largely informal) require-
ments from DNG into contracts is a manual eort, further detailed in the con-
text of Bosch by Post et al. (2012); Post and Hoenicke (2012). CBD languages
provided by FASTEN allow us to model component-based architectures, re-
quirements as contracts (assumptions and guarantees), and renements, hence
creating a CBD. After the design, in Step 2○, FASTEN automatically trans-
lates a CBD to a formal system model Kand renement specication that
allows model checking by NuSMV/nuXMV in Step 3○. This renement speci-
cation follows the scheme by Cimatti and Tonetta (2012) who dene a rene-
ment check by a set of LTL formulae (Kaleeswaran et al. 2020, Section 2). If the
model checker identies any renement inconsistency during the verication,
it returns the violated LTL renement specication and the counterexample.
Taking the violated LTL renement specication and counterexample as
input, the counterexample explanation approach extracts erroneous parts in
Step 4○. To extract such parts, we identify (i) the inconsistent specications in
the violated LTL renement specication, (ii) inconsistent sub-specications
in the inconsistent specications, (iii) erroneous contracts and components by
using the inconsistent specications and by referring to the renement formula,
(iv) erroneous states in the counterexample, and (v) erroneous variables by
using the inconsistent sub-specications (cf. 4A○{4E○in Figure 1).
Finally in Step 5○, a statement is generated explaining inconsistency along
with the counterexample highlighting erroneous states and erroneous vari-
ables . The generated statement consists of the erroneous components , violated
contract information, and inconsistent specications expressed in a pattern-
based language referring to requirements and SysML model being the initial
user input of the approach (cf. 1○in Figure 1). Finally, the inconsistent sub-
specications are highlighted in the pattern-based expression. With the state-
ment, the engineer gets a high-level understanding of the renement inconsis-
tency. Further, the counterexample with highlighted erroneous parts supports
the engineer in understanding the erroneous behavior of the system. Finally,A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 7

the correctness of the changes, the engineer re-veries the changed renement.
5 Research Method
In this section, we discuss the research questions, design, execution plan, target
participants, and analysis plan of the studies.
5.1 Research Questions
Our study aims to explore and understand the challenges in identifying incon-
sistent specications, and the acceptance of formal methods by Bosch auto-
motive engineers. Therefore, this user study has two signicant goals: (G1) to
understand challenges faced by Bosch engineers when identifying inconsistent
specications, and challenges along with their opinions to use formal veri-
cation or formal methods in real-world development processes, and (G2) to
explore whether Bosch engineers are interested in using formal methods, par-
ticularly model checking, in real-world development processes if the diculty
of understanding model checking results is reduced by our counterexample ex-
planation approach. Considering these two goals, we formulate the following
three research questions:
RQ1 : To what extent do engineers face challenges in identifying inconsistent
specications in formal models that are introduced during the renement of a
system?
With this RQ we want to investigate whether:
(I1) Understanding formal notations is dicult for engineers.
(I2) Identifying inconsistent specications that are introduced during a re-
nement of a top-level specication is dicult.
RQ2 : To what extent the identication of inconsistent specications and usage
of formal methods prove benecial to a real-world development process?
With this RQ we want to investigate whether:
(I4) Usage of formal verication or formal methods is benecial in a real-
world development process.
(I5) Identifying inconsistent specications is benecial in a real-world devel-
opment process.
RQ3 : To what extent do engineers prefer to use formal methods (model check-
ers particularly) if the diculty is reduced for understanding verication results
to identify inconsistent specications?
With this RQ we want to investigate whether:A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 9
(I5) The counterexample explanation approach eases the comprehension when
compared to interpretation of the raw model checker output for engineers
with a formal methods background.
(I6) It is possible for engineers with a background in formal methods to iden-
tify and x inconsistent specications based on the counterexample ex-
planation approach.
(I7) The counterexample explanation approach can promote formal verica-
tion and usage of model checking in real-world development processes.
5.2 Variables
To attain the goals G1andG2, we perform two dierent types of exploratory
user studies as shown in Figure 2. The rst study is the user survey (Part 1) ,
and the second study is a one-group pretest-posttest experiment (Part 2) .
5.2.1 Variables of Part 1: User Survey
Our user survey evaluates the research questions RQ1 andRQ2 . The in-
dependent variables of Part 1 areparticipants' professional background and
experience . The dependent variables are dierent for each research questions.
ForRQ1 , the dependent variable is the diculty in understanding that infers
understanding formal notations and identifying inconsistent specications by
engineers are dicult. Similarly, the dependent variable for RQ2 is the in-
crease in condence in system safety , that is, the identication of inconsistent
specications and use of formal methods in real-world development processes
can make systems safer.
5.2.2 Variables of Part 2: One-Group Pretest-Posttest Design
According to Babbie (2016), an experimental stimulus (also called an interven-
tion) is the independent variable. In the one-group pretest-posttest design, we
use our counterexample explanation approach as an intervention. Therefore, it
serves as the independent variable of Part 2 . Further, we evaluate RQ3 based
on the following four attributes that serve as dependent variables for Part 2 :
1.Better understanding: Does the counterexample explanation approach allow
engineers to understand model checking results and identify inconsistencies
more eectively?
2.Quicker understanding: Does the counterexample explanation approach al-
low engineers to understand model checking results and identify inconsis-
tencies more eciently?
3.Condence: Does the counterexample explanation approach make engineers
more condent in their understanding of the system and its inconsistency
respective to safety?10 Kaleeswaran et al.
4.No value: This attribute is inversely related to the above attributes. Will
the counterexample explanation approach provide no or only minimal value
to real-world projects?
For each of the four attributes, the participants are asked one question in
the pretest and posttest in order to collect their opinions about the attributes.
Table 3 lists the questions asked to the participants and the scale of possi-
ble answers in both tests. Particularly, the questions PRQ1 in the pretest and
POQ1 in posttest target the attribute Better understanding , PRQ2 and POQ2
target Quicker understanding , PRQ3 and POQ3 target Condence , and PRQ4
and POQ4 target No value . Finally, comparing the results gathered from both
the pretest and posttest, we can investigate the participants' opinions on un-
derstanding inconsistencies using the proposed counterexample explanation
and the raw counterexample generated by the model checker.

5.3 Design of the User Study
In this section, we describe the design, questionnaires, and tools used for the
user survey (Part 1) and the one-group pretest-posttest experiment (Part 2) .
5.3.1 Part 1: User Survey
ForPart 1 , we use a cross sectional survey (Kitchenham and Peeger 2008)
to collect data from engineers to achieve goal G1. For planning and con-
ducting this user survey, we follow the guidelines by Neuman (2014) (majorly
Chapter 7), Kitchenham and Peeger (2008), and Fink (2003). In addition,
we follow the guidelines by Robson and McCartan (2016) (Chapter 11), and
Babbie (2016) (Chapter 9) for the questionnaire construction. Furthermore,
we also refer to and adapt some of the questionnaires from existing user sur-
veys (Gleirscher and Marmsoler 2020; Garavel et al. 2020). The questionnaire
of our user survey is shown in Table 1. Responses to each question are either
collected as qualitative statements, and/or they follow predened eight-point
Likert scales shown in Table 2.
5.3.2 Part 2: One-Group Pretest-Posttest Experiment
Part 2 of our study is an exploratory pre-experimental study following a one-
group pretest-posttest experiment design to attain goal G2. We follow the
guidelines by Campbell and Stanley (1963) to conduct this part of our study.
One of the main drawbacks of using a one-group pretest-posttest design is
that it does not meet the scientic standards of an experimental design. The
pre-experimental study designs does not have a control group like a true exper-
iment (Wohlin et al. 2012). Thus, comparison and generalization of the results
based on the provided intervention/stimulus may not be possible. However,
we intend to use this pre-experimental study design because of the scarcity
of participants. To nd a considerable number of participants (30 to 40) with
knowledge of formal methods and model checkers inside an industrial organiza-
tion is way too ambitious. Performing a true experiment with a lower number12 Kaleeswaran et al.

of participants raises the threat to external validity. Therefore, we intend to
perform a one-group pretest-posttest experiment with Bosch automotive en-
gineers that allows us to capture results from real-world user behavior, even
with a limited number of participants. However, the pre-experimental study
has several internal and external threats to be considered. In Section 9, we dis-
cuss corresponding threats raised by (Campbell and Stanley 1963, Table 1).
Along with the guidelines by Campbell and Stanley (1963), we refer to
the protocol by Zaidman et al. (2013) for a one-group pretest-posttest exper-
iment. They evaluate a tool called FireDetective that supports understanding
of Ajax applications at both the client-side (browser) and server-side. Their
evaluation is performed using two user study variants (i) pretest-posttest user
study, and (ii) a eld user study, where the former is performed with eight
participants and the latter is performed with two participants. In our study,
we perform the one-group pretest-posttest experiment with Bosch automotive
engineers and discard the eld user study for our evaluation. The question-
naire shown in Table 3 is used for the one-group pretest-posttest study ( Part 2
of our overall study). Similar to Part 1 , responses to each question are either
qualitative statements, selections of options on predened eight-point Likert
scales (Table 2), or a combination of both.
5.4 Tools Used for the Study
Both studies are performed remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In such
a setting, it would not be easy to capture the time that participants spent on
the study. For example, there could be a situation where participants could
have taken a break or could respond to some urgent emails while during the
study. Thus, we asked separately a question for the time taken by the partici-
pants to conduct the pretest and posttest. To perform the studies and collect
the answers by the participants, we use Microsoft Forms for Excel . that is
easily accessible within the company and already familiar to the participants.
The results are stored in a Microsoft Excel le, which we use to perform the
analysis. All content-wise explanations for this study are provided as a video
that are accessible Bosch internally via an online platform called BoschTube .
5.5 Participants
Our counterexample explanation approach focuses on enhancing safety analy-
sis for automotive systems (Kaleeswaran et al. 2020). Thus, we are interested
in performing this user study only with automotive engineers have at least
basic knowledge of formal methods, particularly engineers working on system
development, requirement elicitation, and safety analysis.
The target population for our study is very specic and thus, it is hard to
make a nite list of participants by applying probabilistic sampling. According
to Kitchenham and Peeger (2008), when a target population is very specic14 Kaleeswaran et al.
and limited, non-probabilistic sampling can be used to identify the partici-
pants. Therefore, we intend to use two non-probabilistic sampling methods
forPart 1 of our study, namely, convenience sampling and snowball sampling .
Further, we invite participants with knowledge on formal methods for Part 2
of our study by ltering the participants of Part 1 based on the responses to
the demographic questions Q1 to Q3 listed in Table 1.
First, we start with the convenience sampling for Part 1 . We send e-mails
with the survey link to participants collected through department mailing
lists and community mailing lists of all relevant Bosch business units. We
perform snowball sampling with the accepted participants by asking for further
potential participants at the end of the survey. In the e-mail invitation, we
explicitly mention that the anonymity of results will be preserved. So, while
summarizing analysis results, we remove all personal, product- and project-
related information. For both the studies, the reminder mail is sent three times
in the interval of one week.

boxes indicate the main tasks, i. e., questionnaire survey, pretest and posttest.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 15
5.6 Execution Plan
In this section, we describe the execution plan of the user survey (Part 1) and
theone-group pretest-posttest experiment (Part 2) depicted in Figure 2.
5.6.1 Execution Plan of Part 1
The user survey (Part 1) comprises four steps (Figure 2). First, we notify
participants regarding the data processing agreement. Additionally, we also
state explicitly that their names, project- and product-related information
will be removed while results are shared for evaluation. Then we show a video,
welcoming the participant and explaining the background and motivation of
this survey. Then, we ask participant to answer the demographic questions
(Q1 to Q6 in Table 1), and further the main survey questions (Q7 to Q20 in
Table 1). Finally we conclude the survey with a thanks note.
5.6.2 Execution Plan of Part 2
For the one-group pretest-posttest experiment, we invite participants from
Part 1 who have knowledge in formal methods. Similar to Part 1 ,Part 2 starts
with a data processing agreement, followed by a background and motivation
video. Our one-group pretest-posttest experiment is executed with the invited
participants as follows: a pretest experiment, then intervention, and nally the
posttest experiment.
Pretest. The pretest experiment starts with a video demonstrating the exper-
iment with a simple example of an OR-gate and the behavior of the OR-gate.
After that, another video introduces an airbag system with the corresponding
system model and specication, that serves as a use case for the actual pretest
experiment. During the actual experiment, the participant analyzes the vio-
lated specication and the counterexample returned by the model checker to
understand the inconsistent parts of the specication. Furthermore, based on
the understanding, the participant answers the task questions (TQ1 to TQ9
except of TQ4 in Table 3). Finally, the pretest is concluded by answering the
pre-questionnaire survey questions PRQ1 to PRQ4 listed in Table 3.
Intervention. After the pretest experiment, a video introducing the counterex-
ample explanation approach Kaleeswaran et al. (2020) is shown to the partic-
ipants. This serves as an intervention in our study.
Posttest. Like the steps followed for the pretest experiment, the posttest ex-
periment starts with a demonstration video with the same use case of the
OR-gate, but this time with the counterexample explanation approach. This
is followed by a video that introduces the electronic power steering system
(EPS), a commercial Bosch product, with the corresponding system model and
specication. Then the participants interpret the explanation provided by the16 Kaleeswaran et al.
counterexample explanation approach to understand the inconsistency. Based
on the explanation, participants answer the task questions (TQ1 to TQ9 except
of TQ3 in Table 3). Subsequently, they answer the post-questionnaire survey
questions POQ1 to POQ4 listed in Table 3. After completing the posttest ex-
periment, participants rate the features (FQ1 to FQ6 in Table 3) provided by
the counterexample explanation approach and respond to the feedback ques-
tions (FE1 to FE8 in Table 3). Finally, Part 2 of our study concludes with a
thanks note to the participants.
5.7 Presentation of the Analysis Results
To obtain the results from the study, we follow the recommendation by Robbins
and Heiberger (2011). We use normal, grouped and stacked bar charts to plot
the results. Qualitative statements received from participants are gathered, or-
ganized, and summarized individually for every question. We summarize the
qualitative statements through the following three steps: (i) Microanalysis:
The rst author goes through the individual answers from the participants
and assigns labels to the statements. The rest of the authors validate the ini-
tial labels and provide feedback for improvement. At the end of this step, all
authors come to a mutual agreement on the initial labels. (ii) Categorization:
Based on the feedback for improvement, the rst author performs second it-
eration. As a result, a set of themes are extracted which are deemed to be
essential. (iii) Saturation: This is the nal step where all the authors come to
the nal agreement on labels, themes, and summarized statements. Since the
qualitative statement is a medium to express an individual opinion, the cate-
gorization of labels are associated with the demographic answers. For example:
\an engineer who has seven years of experience states that the counterexample
explanation approach can promote the usage of model checkers among system
engineers" .
6 User Survey (Part 1): Results and Analysis
In this section, we present and analyze the results of the user survey ( Part 1 ).
We gathered answers to the questionnaire shown in Table 1 from 41 participants.
6.1 Participants
We rst present demographic information of the participants that we obtained
from the rst six questions of the questionnaire ( Q1toQ6in Table 1).
6.1.1 Experience in Formal Methods and Safety
The experience of the participants in using formal methods and their experi-
ence focusing on safety are collected through the questions Q3and Q4(Ta-A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 17

ble 1), which are answered in scale LS2 (Table 2). Participants are asked to
ll in their experience in formal methods gained individually in academia, and
in industry, and their overall experience in academia and industry combined
together with Q3, while Q4collects industrial experience in safety. Figure 3
represents the responses for experience in formal methods and safety.
From Figure 3, it is clear that all the 41 participants have gained knowledge
in formal methods in academia or industry to some extent . When excluding
13 participants who have no academic experience in formal methods, the pre-
dominant number of participants (82% of all participants who have academic
experience) have experience of <6 years. Likewise, excluding 6 participants
who do not have industrial experience in formal methods, the number of par-
ticipants who have experience of <2 years is dominant (40% of all participants
who have industrial experience). 29% of all participants with some experience
in industry only have 1 to <2 years of experience.
In summary, 52% of all participants have <2 years, 24% have 2 to <6 years,
no participants with 6 to <8 years, and 24% have >8 years of experience in
formal methods. Looking at the participants' experience on safety, the results
are scattered, with no clear majority. Excluding the 9 participants who do not
have any experience in safety, 41% of all participants are experienced 1 to <4
years, further 41% are experience 4 to <8 years, 9% of participants have <1
year of experience, and the nal 9% have >10 years of experience.
6.1.2 Knowledge of Formal Methods
Question Q1(Table 1) asks participants to rate their knowledge in formal
methods according to the scale LS1 (Table 2). Figure 4 shows the results. All
participants have rated their knowledge within the scale novice toexpert , while
no participant provided a rating of mastery andpractical wisdom . The major-18 Kaleeswaran et al.

ity of participants rate their knowledge in formal methods as advanced beginner
andexpert with 27% of all participants each. Further, eight participants (20%)
rate themselves as a novice , seven participants (17%) as competent , and four
participants rate themselves to be procient .
Figure 4 also presents participants' knowledge together with their years of
experience in formal methods. The majority of participants with an experience
of<1 year rated themselves as novice , with 1 to <2 years of experience as
advanced beginner , and those with 8 to <10 years and >10 years of experience
rated themselves as an expert . However, the participants who have experience
of 2 to<4 years and 4 to <6 years have distributed their rating among various
classes. Participants with experience of 2 to <4 years rated themselves from
advanced beginner toexpert , participants with 4 to <6 years of experience
rated themselves from competent toexpert .
6.1.3 Designation
Designations of the participants are collected with a free text eld for ques-
tion Q2(Table 1), depicted in Figure 5a. The majority of the participants
(11 participants, 27%) consider themselves as safety manager/engineer , 22%
assystems engineer , and 20% as a research engineer . Further, 11 participants
(27%) are either an expert or an architect in either safety, system, software,
or verication.

puter (9 participants). These are also the most-called applications for safety
aspects (9 participants each), followed by power supply system (8 participants)
and driver-assistance system (7 participants).
6.2 Understanding Formal Notations
With question Q7(Table 1), we collect the participants' opinions on under-
standing formal notations. The possible answers follow the scale LS3 (Table 2)
and further allow comments as free text. Table 4 shows the results according to
the scale. The majority (80% of all participants) is almost equally distributed
between answers hard and slightly easy . 44% nd formal notations between
slightly hard and extremely hard , 34% nd formal notations between slightly
easy and extremely easy . In the received comments, the majority of partici-
pants agree that understanding formal notations gets easier with more usage
and experience, and that it is highly dependent on the focus of the system
domain such as automotive and railway. A supporting statement from a par-
ticipant answering slightly easy states that \If I am familiar with the formal
language in which the formal notations are written (e.g., rst-order language),
typically it is easy."
Figure 6 shows responses for understanding formal notations based on the
participants' knowledge in formal methods ( cf.Section 6.1.2) and designation
(cf.Section 6.1.3). For the following discussion, we cluster answers among ex-
tremely hard ,hard, and slightly hard as \harder" and the ones among extremely
easy,easy, and slightly easy as \easier".

Understanding of formal notations based on knowledge in formal methods.
Looking at novice s and advanced beginner s in Figure 6a, the predominant
number of participants perceives understanding of formal notations as harder .
Among the 11 expert s, ve participants perceive understanding formal nota-
tions to be harder , while three participants perceive understanding formal no-
tation as easier . This is notable because even the majority of experts perceive
understanding of formal notation to be harder . A participant rated as being an
expert and answered hard mentions understanding notations used in logics like
LTL, CTL, or TCTL are pretty straightforward, but using them to formalize
real-world requirements is harder. Another expert who answers extremely easy
states that using approaches like pattern-based languages (Dwyer et al. 1999)
helps to ease understanding formal notations.
Understanding of formal notations based on participants' designation. Partic-
ipants with designations of a system/software architect ,systems engineer , and
verication engineer perceive formal notations to be harder to understand
while the same number of participants from each of the three mentioned cate-
gories vote for formal notations to be easier for understanding. A verication
expert highlights: \In general, formal notations are clear and precise. How-
ever, even for very experienced engineers, some formal notations (for example
in temporal logics) are hard to understand on the semantic level, i.e., really
telling what the formula means for the system at hand." Considering the des-
ignations of a safety/security expert and verication expert , the majority of
the answers (excluding neither hard nor easy ) opt for understanding formal
notations to be easier with two out of three participants and one participant in
each designation. For the remaining designations of a safety manager/engineer
and research engineer , the majority of participants answer that understand-
ing notations are harder with six out of 11 participants and ve out of eight
participants, respectively. A systems engineer state that \I have never really
learned formal notation; thus, I learned it on the job. A real introduction might
have turned out helpful."A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 21
Summary. 44% of all participants answer understanding formal notations to
be hard, only 34% of participants perceive understanding of formal notations
as easy. From the answers received as free text, it is clear that experience plays
a major role in understanding formal notations.
6.3 Inconsistent Formal Specications
In this section, we discuss diculties in identifying inconsistent specications,
understanding inconsistencies, the time taken to identify inconsistent speci-
cations, as well as challenges and dierent methods to identify inconsistent
specications based on the answers to questions Q9toQ13 (Table 1).
6.3.1 Identifying Inconsistent Formal Specication
With question Q9, we assess diculties of identifying inconsistent formal spec-
ications. Answers are given according to the scale LS3 (Table 2) and as free
text. The results of the answering 41 participants are shown in Table 5. No-
tably, a majority (51%) perceive the identication of inconsistent formal spec-
ications as hard, with a total of 73% perceiving it as at least slightly hard .
From the free-text responses, 13 participants state that the eort of iden-
tifying inconsistent specications highly depends on the kind of specication,
as well as the complexity of the specication and system. For example, a
verication expert who answers neither hard nor easy states that identifying
inconsistent specication \depends on the size and kind of specication, e. g.,
debugging temporal logic is not trivial." Regarding complexity of the speci-
cation, a systems engineer highlights an example that it \depends on the
complexity of the formal specication itself and how well the inconsistency is
hidden, e. g., x<10andx>20is easy to stop, but if you replace one x with
y and link them somewhere else, it's already hard to nd." However, on con-
trary, an interesting point is highlighted by a verication expert , stating that
one\can't really say, [as it] highly depends on the complexity of the application.
With respect to model checking activation/deactivation of autonomous driving
functions we realized that even small state machines can contain possibly criti-
cal errors. Also, these errors would have never been identied by classic testing
(test runs, simulation)."
Identication of inconsistent formal specications based on participants knowl-
edge in formal methods. Figure 7 depicts the responses gathered for identifying
inconsistent specications together with the participants' knowledge in for-
mal methods. The count of responses as harder is dominating all the classes

ranging from novice toexpert . Among all participants who answer identify-
ing inconsistent specications is easier , the majority is either procient or an
expert in formal methods. An expert safety engineer states that \the degree
of diculty heavily depends on the nature of the formalism: Spotting an error
in a boolean formula is signicantly easier than identifying erroneous temporal
specication, which is again signicantly easier compared to spotting erroneous
specication for continuous behavior" .
Summary. Predominantly, participants answer that identication of inconsis-
tent specications is hard. Free-text answers agree that the eort for identifying
inconsistent specications highly depends on the complexity of specications
and systems.
6.3.2 Understanding inconsistency in formal specications
The question Q10 (Table 1) is used to collect whether understanding of the
actual inconsistency in the identied inconsistent specications is easier or
harder . The answer scale used to collect the response is again LS3 and a free
text eld. Responses are aggregated in Table 6, where 39 participants provided
a rating, while two participants indicated no opinion .
The result is comparable to the result obtained for identifying inconsistent
specication in Section 6.3.1. The predominant number of 18 participants an-

swers understanding inconsistency in the formal specications is hard. Overall
77% of participants responded at least slightly hard . 13% answer neither hard
nor easy and perceive it easier .
Three participants who answer neither hard nor easy highlight that the
eort of understanding the inconsistency in formal specications depends on
the complexity of specication and the system. A verication expert with
the response hard states that \the key question is: whether the model or the
specication is wrong i. e., nding inconsistencies can often not only be done
on the level of just the specication".
Understanding inconsistency in formal specications based on the participants'
knowledge in formal methods. Figure 8 depicts the responses gathered for un-
derstanding inconsistency in formal specications together with the partici-
pants knowledge in formal methods ( cf.Section 6.1.2). The majority of par-
ticipants from novices toexperts perceive understanding of inconsistencies to
beharder . Particularly, this view is shared by six of eight novices , seven of 11
advance beginners , four of seven competents , all four procients , and seven of
11experts .
One of the advanced beginners explains a common industrial issue: \under-
standing can be hard especially when the specications have multiple authors,
each holding a slightly dierent view on the object to be specied". Asys-
tem/software architect who rates their knowledge in formal methods as expert ,
states that \formal proofs typically lead to the source of the error. Counterex-
amples in model checkers also help a lot" . On contrary to this statement a
systems engineer who rates their knowledge in formal methods as expert high-
lights that it depends on the particular inconsistency, e. g., if it is real-time

inconsistency that only occurs after several cycles, then it is dicult to nd
even with the help of counterexamples.
Summary. Similar to the result of identifying inconsistent specication in Sec-
tion 6.3.2, a majority of participants (77%) value understanding of the incon-
sistency as harder. In the free-text responses, participants indicate that the
eort to understand an inconsistency depends on the complexity of the speci-
cation and system. Further, some of the responses highlight the use of tools like
model checkers to support identication and understanding of inconsistencies.
6.3.3 Time Taken to Identify Inconsistent Formal Specications
With question Q11 (Table 1), we consider the time that it takes to identify
inconsistent specications. The answers follow scale LS4 (Table 2) and al-
low for a free-text comment. Table 7 represents the response collected from
37 participants as four participants responded no opinion .
A majority of participants, 18 of them (44% of all participants) answer
that the time taken to identify inconsistent specications is slower (slightly
slow,slow, and extremely slow ). Further, 12 participants (29%) answer that
the time taken to identify inconsistent specications is neither fast nor slow ,
with six participants stating that it depends on the complexity and number
of specications.
Asystem/software architect answering with slightly slow highlights that
\the time it takes is the time taken to understand requirements" . Further, a
verication expert states that in one of their projects it took a couple of hours
to formalize the system model and specications, but only a few seconds to
then run the model checking and perform verication and further optimization.
Seven participants (17%) answer that the time taken to identify incon-
sistent specications is faster (slightly fast ,fast, and extremely fast ). Three
of them answer that by using a model checker, the time taken to identify
inconsistent specications is reduced.
Time taken to identify inconsistent formal specications grouped by the par-
ticipants' knowledge in formal methods. Figure 9 presents the results of time
taken to identify inconsistent formal specications grouped by the partici-
pants' knowledge ( cf.Section 6.1.2). The majority of participants who rate
their knowledge as novice ,advanced beginner ,competent , and expert answer
that the time taken to identify inconsistent specications is slower orneither
fast nor slow . Five of seven participants who answer faster rated themselves

asprocient and experts . The majority answers of about 37% of all partic-
ipants respond that using formal verication makes very probably a system
safer while 34% vote for denitely safer.
Summary. In total, 44% of the participants answer that identifying inconsis-
tent formal specications is slower . In fact, 44% is predominant here because
29% of them have the neutral response answering neither fast nor slow and
only 17% of the participants answer to be faster . Free-text responses indicate
that the time it takes depends on the kind of specications and the complexity
of the system and specications. This is similar to the responses received for
identifying inconsistent specications in Section 6.3.1 and Section 6.3.2.
6.3.4 Challenges to Identify Inconsistent Specications
With question Q12 (Table 1), we collect challenges in identifying inconsistent
specication based on free-text responses. The responses are summarized based
on the participants' designations.
Architects and Experts. Most of the system/software architects ,safety/security
experts , and verication experts highlight two general challenges: (1) architec-
tural models and system requirements are often incomplete in industry, and
(2) understanding the semantics and formal notations. A notable statement
from a system/software architect is that \if the specication has many items
(which is very common in the industry), checking them one-by-one by human
is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, if the specication is written
in natural language, how to interpret it in an objective way can also be a ques-
tion" . Further, a verication expert states that it is challenge to \understand26 Kaleeswaran et al.
the intended semantics of the specications at scale" . Another notable state-
ment from a safety/security expert is that \the prime challenge is to identify
inconsistency and then to get acceptance to the amount of inconsistencies [that
can be tolerated]" .
Safety Managers/Engineers. Two main challenges listed by safety managers
and engineer are: (1) understanding formal specication and (2) understand-
ing verication results. A safety engineer rated as expert states that \some
notions (e. g., LTL formulas) are hard to understand. Often you just think you
understood correctly what they mean while using them the wrong way. Further-
more, there might be corner cases in the processes to be described which make
your life particularly hard, e. g., specic startup behavior of systems. Even sim-
ple formulas tend to become huge quickly, which makes it pretty hard to focus" .
Furthermore, a statement from a novice is, that \it is not really intuitive to
understand the dependencies between the formal specications { especially if
you investigate a larger set of specications" .
Systems Engineers. The main challenge mentioned by systems engineers are
formalizing specications. A systems engineer rated as expert states that \the
main challenge to identify inconsistent formal specications is that specica-
tions have to be formalized rst. There are only few engineers at Bosch who
want to do that, even semi formal requirements patterns are seldom used" .
Further, a challenge mentioned by a systems engineer rated as competent is
\insucient granularity of high-level system behavior, thus dicult to perform
verication" . In addition, a general challenge to identify inconsistent speci-
cation is that \often hundreds of cases/situations have to be considered while
only a few are inconsistent" .
Research Engineers and Verication Engineers. Two challenges identied by
research engineers and verication engineers are: (1) complexity in using ap-
propriate tools, and (2) understanding the verication results. A research en-
gineer rated as procient states that the \large size and complexity of the
specication might not allow one to debug it manually. When the formal spec-
ication is written in an expressive language and is very complex in general,
automatic method for formal analysis might not scale either" . Further, a ver-
ication engineer highlights that even if a model checker supports to identify
an inconsistent specication, the time taken to perform verication for large
system is huge. Regarding explainability, a research engineer states that in-
consistencies detected by the verication tools are cryptic and thus, require
additional support to derive a useful explanation.
Summary. From the collected responses, the four dierent challenges to iden-
tify inconsistent specication are: (1) verication performed with incomplete
models, (2) understanding formal semantics, notations, and specications,
(3) complexity in using verication tools, and (4) understanding of verication
results by domain experts.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 27
6.3.5 Methods used for Verication
As discussed in Section 6.3.2, several participants mentioned the use of veri-
cation methods to identify inconsistent specications and understanding the
inconsistencies. With Q13 (Table 1), we collect the used verication methods
with a free-text eld. Several participants mentioned multiple methods. All
responses are clustered into ve dierent methods shown in Table 8.
The predominantly used methods are model checking with 18 participants
andmanual inspection/review with ten participants. Manual inspection/review
is the only purely manual method, the other methods like model checking ,sim-
ulation ,reasoner ,contract-based design are (semi-)automated methods, sup-
ported by appropriate tools. Five participants indicate that model checkers
support overcoming the manual inspection to nd inconsistency.
Methods used for verication based on designation. Figure 10 represents the
dierent verication methods together with participants' designation. Model
checking is used by at least one participant of each designation. Manual in-
spection/review is mostly mentioned by systems engineers and safety man-
agers/engineers ,simulation mostly by systems engineers and verication ex-
perts,reasoners byresearch engineers , and contract-based design mostly by
safety managers/engineers .

results obtained for identifying inconsistent formal specications in Section
6.3.1. Since the results for both identifying inconsistent specication ( cf.Sec-
tion 6.3.1) and understanding inconsistent specication ( cf.Section 6.3.2) are
similar, we choose to discuss the relation only with results of identifying in-
consistent specication.
As a majority of the participants (21 of 41 participants) have answered that
identifying inconsistent formal specications is hard, they mentioned each of
the listed methods at least once. To be more precise, among 21 participants
who answer hard for identifying inconsistent specication, eight participants
usemanual inspection/review while seven of them use model checking . Addition-
ally, participants who answer extremely hard are found to use model checking
andcontract-based design . A participant who rated herself/himself as procient
and classify the problem as hard state that the correct usage of verication
tools is mostly an error-prone way. Furthermore, an expert states: \If you see
UML Models Rhapsody/EA as formal models: typically, they are not complete
and therefore model checker do not support well" . On other hand, participants
classifying the problem as easier are found to use model checking and man-
ual inspection/review . An advanced beginner classifying the problem as easy
by using manual inspection/review highlights that \by using the modern re-
quirement engineering tools traceability can be maintained within dependent
specication and corresponding architectural model" .
Summary. From the collected responses, ve dierent verication methods
are used to identify inconsistent specications: model checking ,manual inspec-
tion/review ,simulation ,reasoner , and contract-based design . Among these, the
predominantly used methods are model checking andmanual inspection/review ,
mentioned by 18 participants and ten participants respectively.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 29
6.4 Renement of Specications
The early stages in the V-model (Weber 2009) are about rening the top-level
requirements and associate them to system components and sub-components.
With questions Q14 and Q15 (Table 1), we investigate whether maintain-
ing the consistency of rened specications with a system architecture and
verifying the renement consistency are harder oreasier .
6.4.1 Consistency of Rened Specications and System Architectures
With question Q14 (Table 1), we collects the responses whether maintain-
ing consistency of the rened specications is harder oreasier following the
answer scale LS3 in Table 2. Twelve out of 41 participants state that they
have no opinion and thus, the responses received from 29 participants are
shown in Table 9. The predominant number of participants answer that main-
taining consistency is hard and slightly hard , with an exact count of nine
participants (31% of responded participants) each. Overall, most participants
(20 participants, 69% of all participants) answer that maintaining consistency
isharder , eight participants (28%) answer with easier , and one participant
(3%) with neither hard nor easy .
Maintaining renement consistency grouped by the participants' experience in
formal methods. Figure 12 depicts the results of maintaining renement consis-
tency between the specications and architecture considering the participants'
knowledge in formal methods ( cf.Section 6.1.2). Participants who rate the dif-
culty as extremely hard arenovices and advanced beginners while those who
answer extremely easy are designated as an expert . Since the majority of partic-
ipants rate the diculty as harder (cf.Table 9), all the categories from novice
toexpert have higher count for harder than easier . An advance beginner who
rates the problem as hard highlights: \It depends on the size and complexity of
the System-Architecture; in L4 Sensor-set architectures it[']s hard" . Addition-
ally, an expert states that performing a manual review with natural language
requirements against the requirements of the higher abstraction level in a
contract-based design is hard. From all of the categories except of procient ,
at least one participant answers that maintaining inconsistent specications is
easier . An advanced beginner whose rates the problem as easy mentions: \I as-
sume I formulated a formal requirement for the parent component, and I have
to dene formal requirements for sub-components, I think that is straight for-
ward. If somebody else wrote the formal requirement of the parent component,
it becomes harder since I need to understand what is expressed there rst" .

Figure 13 depicts the results for the diculty of maintaining renement con-
sistency between the specications and architecture grouped by the partici-
pants' designations ( cf.Section 6.1.3). Focusing on valid responses (excluding
no opinion ) from system/software architects ,safety/security expert , and veri-
cation expert , four participants answer harder and three participants answer
easier . Notably, among two system/software architects , one answers extremely
easy and the another one answers extremely hard . The participants who answer
extremely easy state that using model-based development it is easy to maintain
the consistency with natural language requirements. Additionally, according
to a system/software architect who answers slightly hard , maintaining rene-A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 31

like state machines one can keep complexity under control" . Participants from
the remaining designations like systems engineer ,verication engineer ,safety
manager/engineer , and research engineer , predominantly rated the problem
asharder . Asafety manager/engineer classifying the problem as slightly hard
states: \To maintain the consistency, we need to rene all software develop-
ment phases results from requirements till test" .
Summary. Among all of the 29 participants who answered this question, 20 parti-
cipants (69%) vote that maintaining consistency is harder . From the free-text
eld responses, the majority of the participants nds that maintaining consis-
tency is harder when the system gets complex. Furthermore, a notable response
is that model-based system development could ease maintaining consistency.
6.4.2 Verication of the Renement Consistency
With question Q15 (Table 1), we collect the responses whether verifying re-
ned specications is harder oreasier . Possible responses follow answer scale
LS3 in Table 2. Among the 41 participants, eleven answer to have no opin-
ionwhile the remaining 30 participants rate the diculty of the verication
problem. The overall result shown in Table 10 is similar to the responses of
Q14 about maintaining consistency discussed in Section 6.4.1. The majority of
24 participants (80% of responded participants) answer that verifying rened
specications is harder . Further four participants answer it to be easier and two
participants answer, neither hard nor easy . Notably, among the 24 participants
who answer harder , 16 (66%) answer hard which takes the predominant count
of all the given options.

problem of verifying renement consistency as easier . Aprocient participant
mentions: \You can only rely on provisioned tools (model checker)" . Among
the rest, at least one participant answers that verifying renement consistency
iseasier , however, the majority of the answers rate it to be harder . According
to an advanced beginner rating the problem as hard, the diculty depends on
the formalization of requirements: \If you mean non-formal requirements, I

on the designation of a safety/security expert , one participant answers that

support, checking can be extremely tedious" . With the designations of a veri-
cation engineer, safety manager/engineer, and research engineer as exceptions,
all other designations have at least one participant rating the diculty as eas-
ier. Averication engineer rating the problem as neither hard nor easy men-
tions: \Ideally, the formal requirements should be specied in a way that they
can be automatically checked by some tool { then it is easy" . Additionally, a
systems engineer rating the problem as easy states that \[i]t is easy as long as
the requirements can be functionally separated. If dierent requirements have
impact on a state behavior or contradicting safety goals, it is hard" .
Summary. Among the 30 participants who provide a response other than hav-
ingno opinion , 80% perceive the verication of renement consistency as a
harder problem. Furthermore, most participants who rated the problem as
easier highlight that the eort of verifying renement consistency could be
reduced by using well-formalized specications and verication tools.
6.5 Formal Verication Focusing on Safety
With questions Q16 toQ18, we collect the participants' opinion on weather
formal verication could support safety analysis and make a system safer.
6.5.1 Using Formal Verication to Make Systems Safer
Particularly, with question Q16 we investigate the opinion of participants on
whether using formal verication could make a system safer (response accord-
ing to scale LS5 in Table 2 plus free-text comments). Aggregated responses are
shown in Table 11. A predominant number of participants answers denitely
(14 participants, 34%) and very probably (15 participants, 37%).
Most free-text comments collected by participants who answer denitely ,
very probably , orprobably highlight that formal verication is required to tackle
the increasing system complexity and shorten development time. A research
engineer , whose answer is denitely , states that \it can provide yet another
level of surety about the safety of systems. The more sure we are the better it
is. The human brain tries to save energy. As a human, we may overlook a lot
of details when it comes to habitual/routine work. This is where formal meth-
ods can provide further surety about safer systems." Asafety engineer , whose
answer is very probably , highlights a further challenge in industry: \Personally,
I think it is useful if the environment is open to this (e. g., interested in the re-
sults and willing to spend resources on it) and you have the right well-trained
people working on it. However, I've seen these ideas failing too many times

in industry. I conclude that in most cases using formal verication is not yet
ready for production."
Relation to participants' experience in safety. Figure 16 depicts the results of
using formal verication to make systems safer based on the participants' in-
dustrial experience in safety. Nine participants with no experience present their
view that using formal verication makes denitely ,very probably , orprobably
the systems safer. All of the participants with <1 year experience answer that
using formal verication could make the system denitely safer. An example
statement by a systems engineer without safety experience states that \[g]aps
and errors can be found earlier, easier and with higher reliability." Considering
the experience levels from 1 to <2 years and up to >10 years, the majority of
participants answer with very probably . Asafety manager/engineer with 2 to
<4 years of experience who answered with very probably mentions that formal
verication \can help to make system consistent and reduce the human error."
Furthermore, another safety manager/engineer strengthens this view: \With
higher system and organizational complexity combined with shorter develop-
ment time, the need for more formal methods is increasing."
Focusing on the answers possibly and denitely not , two participants ei-
ther with 1 to <2 or 4 to<6 years of experience answer possibly while one
participant with 6 to <8 years of experience answers denitely not . Asafety
manager/engineer , whose answer is denitely not , states the following: \We
need to distinguish between two terms: Reliability and Safety. The formal ver-
ication are used to dene the failures /Errors in software but not necessary
that the all errors are safety-critical " . Finally, a verication engineer , whose
answer is possibly , highlights that formal verication \could potentially make
them safer, but I think the eort is probably too high in relation to the benet."A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 35
Summary. The majority answers of about 37% of all participants respond that
using formal verication makes very probably a system safer while 34% vote
fordenitely safer. Most of the participants highlight that using automated
formal verication methods could reduce a lot of manual work. However, a
considerable number of participants also highlight that without proper training
it is hard to imagine using formal verication in industry.
6.5.2 Formal Verication as an Add-on
With question Q17, we collect the participants' opinion whether formal ver-
ication could be a meaningful addition to the functional safety methods to
ensure safety (possible answers follow scale LS5 in Table 2 and allow free-text
comments). Among the 41 participants, 39 have answered this question. Re-
sults are shown in Table 12. From these 39 participants, 19 (49%) answer that
formal verication could denitely be an add-on to functional safety methods,
and eleven participants (28%) consider this as very probably . Asafety man-
ager/engineer , whose answer is very probably , states that \formal verication
methods probably can [be] used to specify and verify the functional safety related
properties of the system e. g., time related issues such as Fault-Tolerance Time
Intervals etc." The answers to question Q16 (cf.Section 6.5.1) correlates with
the results shown in Table 12.

Relation to participants' safety experience. Figure 17 depicts the results grouped
by the participants' experience in safety ( cf.Section 6.1.1). The predominant
number of participants having an experience of 6 to <8 years and >10 years
answer denitely . Asafety manager/engineer with 6 to<8 years of experience
states: \To me, formal verication is already a method to achieve functional
safety. It's just not applied widely. Formal verication itself cannot ensure
safety, it can just contribute." Furthermore, a system/software architect with
>10 years of experience mentions the challenge that mostly formal verica-
tion is not scalable, and very costly. Notably, among all participants, only one
participant who answers with probably not and having between six and eight
years of experience states the following: \We have two terms: functional safety
addresses E/E failures in the systems and SOTIF (safety of intended func-
tionality) addresses the safety issues in absence of E/E failures. Therefore, to
ensure safety, we need to reduce the hazards which are related to E/E failures
+ Performance limitations."
Summary. 19 participants (49% of the responding participants) deem formal
verication denitely to be an add-on to classical functional safety methods.
From the free-text responses, most participants state that formal verication
together with functional safety methods could address more system safety
issues.
6.5.3 Benet of Identifying Inconsistent Specications
With question Q18, we collect the participants' opinion whether identifying
inconsistent formal specications is benecial for a safety analysis (possible an-
swers are dened by scale LS5 in Table 2 and allow free-text comments). Forty
participants provided answers and one participant had no opinion (Table 13).
The majority of 21 participants (53%) rates identifying inconsistent formal
specications denitely benecial for a safety analysis. The second most-called
answer with 15 votes (38%) is very probably . Asystem/software architect an-
swering denitely states that \it is benecial because: (1) it saves time and
eort trying to resolve the inconsistencies in the future, and (2) avoids possible
security threat due to the vagueness in the specication." A research engineer
highlights that \naturally, safety critical application which rely on inconsistent
formal specications can never be guaranteed to function reliably."
Relation to participants' experience in safety. Figure 18 depicts the results in
relation to the participants' experience in safety. A majority of participants
between 0 to 8 years and >10 years vote for denitely . Aresearch engineer
answering denitely and with 2 to <4 years of experience states that \if formal
methods were to be used extensively in the production domain, it would be
very important because it is the starting point of the analysis and will have
great inuence on the results." Further, a safety manager/engineer with 6 to
<8 years experience mentions that \[identifying] inconsistent specication is
denitely benecial, not so much for the safety analysis but for the safety ofA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 37

of the product." Looking at all benets, a safety manager/engineer answering
denitely and with 4 to <6 years experience mentions that \it is indeed very
helpful. However, the harder part is to write correct (partial) specications in
the rst place. If you fail to do so, there is no benet from making your (awed)
specication consistent."
Summary. 53% of the participants who provided responses see that identify-
ing inconsistent formal specications could denitely be benecial for a safety
analysis. Most of the free-text comments highlight that identifying inconsis-
tencies could save time and eort very early and improve system safety.
6.6 Using Formal Verication
The questions Q8,Q19, and Q20 (Table 1) collect the participants' opinions
on using formal verication in general, imagining using formal methods if un-
derstanding formal notations is eased, and using formal methods in real-world
development. The responses to these questions are discussed in the following.
6.6.1 Opinions on Using Formal Verication in General
Question Q8collects opinions of the participants on using formal verication
with a free-text eld. The responses are categorized based on the participants'
designations.38 Kaleeswaran et al.
System/Software Architects and Safety/Security Experts. Asystem/software
architect with their knowledge rated as expert advises to \not try to model your
whole system with formal methods. Model relevant aspects and check them."
In addition, a system/software architect as an advanced beginner states, that
\[formal methods] are helpful and can bring great help if used properly. How-
ever, there could be some eort initially for translating existing specications
into the representation or notation used by formal verication tools." Further
two system/software architects mention that with the required knowledge it
is easy to use formal tools but still the question remains whether it scales to
industrial systems.
Responses from safety/security experts show that they are interested in
dierent perspectives. For example, a safety/security expert who is an advanced
beginner states the expectation that \one very promising solution is needed to
compose/decompose safety requirements for component based development."
Further, an expert highlights that they only \see rare use cases, since the
benet most often does not outweigh the costs (yet). This is, however, dierent
when the formal verication is practically hidden and specication is intuitive.
See for example type systems for programming languages checked by compilers
without support from the user."
Verication Experts and Verication Engineers. The responses received by
verication experts and engineers indicate that they are mainly interested
in verifying system architectures and requirements. A verication expert high-
lights that \if hard statements about correctness are required, [formal methods]
are inevitable if they can be used. In addition, they are very good at nding
corner cases that are hard to nd (e. g., transient errors resulting from concur-
rency)." Further, a verication engineer states that formal methods \should
be used for highly critical parts (only). I'm not sure if it is useful to apply it
on higher levels (e.g. system architecture). That might help to get a consis-
tent picture on that level, but will probably not help to ultimately build a safe
system, as the properties can usually not be checked on implementation level."
Safety Managers/Engineers, Systems Engineers, and Research Engineers.
Most of the safety managers/engineer and systems engineer are interested
to use formal methods, but the complexity of using and understanding formal
tools stands as a barrier. For example, a safety engineer states that formal
methods \can bring a huge benet to safety engineering, but some fundamen-
tal challenges remain (competency of engineers applying formal methods and
tools)." Furthermore, according to the statement by a systems engineer ,\for-
mal verication is powerful, but to get the acceptance we have to keep the
formal stu away from the users. E.g., Astree, Polyspace, QA-C all nd de-
fects, that are nearly impossible to detect by hand written tests. Astree and
Polyspace nd more than QA-C, still, many projects use QA-C, as it is ex-
tremely easy to use even for people without knowledge in formal methods."
In addition, a research engineer highlights a crucial challenge: \I do think
it makes sense to apply formal verication especially on highly complex andA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 39
safety-critical system, but the hurdle might be very high for its wide appli-
cation. We will require not only safety engineers to understand the method,
notation, syntax, etc. but also e. g., system designers, software developers. If
external certication authority is involved in the certication process, it might
be an additional challenge to present the safety case (unless they are experts
in formal verication)."
Summary. The majority of collected responses are very positive in using for-
mal verication to improve the system safety and design. But, on other hand
understanding and scalability of verication (tools) remain as obstacles.
6.6.2 Opinions on Using Formal Verication if Understanding of Formal
Notations is Eased
Question Q19 collects the opinion of participants on whether making formal
notations more understandable could improve the usage of formal methods.
The possible answers follow scale LS5in Table 2 and can be extended with free-
text comments. All of the 41 participants provided responses, which are shown
in Table 14. The majority of participants (23, i. e., 56%) answer that making
formal notations more understandable could denitely improve the usage of
formal methods. Eleven participants (27%) estimate that it will very probably
provide an improvement. A verication expert answering denitely highlights
that \increasing understandability of formal specications is key to bringing
them into a more wide-spread use. See for example Gladisch et al. (2019)
lessons learned on SBT and the STL specications." Finally, four participants
expect that easing understanding of notations will probably improve the usage
of formal verication while and one participant each votes for neither probably
nor possibly ,possibly , and probably not .
Understanding of formal notations is made easier based on formal methods
knowledge. Figure 19 depicts the results of whether making formal notations
more understandable could improve the usage of formal methods considering
the participants' knowledge in formal methods ( cf.Section 6.1.2). Except of
novices , the majority of participants rated from advanced beginners toexperts
expect a denite improvement. A highlighting statement from a safety engi-
neer with knowledge rated as an advanced beginner states that, however, \it
is not just the decision of the safety team, also the System, SW and maybe
the HW experts and also testers needs to understand it to make the invest-
ment in formal methods reasonable." In addition, a safety engineer states the

following: \To me, understandability is one of the main reasons that it [for-
mal verication] is not applied, besides the huge initial eort (modeling and
specifying a system formally)."
From participants with expert knowledge in formal methods, one partic-
ipant each answers with neither probably nor possibly ,possibly , and probably
not. From the collected free-text comments, most participants consider the for-
malization of system models and specications from informal systems descrip-
tions and requirements as challenging. For example, a participant answering
with neither probably nor possibly highlights that \the problem is not related
to method itself but it is related to how you use the method and what are the
inputs, and how you understand the system architecture and artifacts. Also,
how you apply the method and so on." A further participant answering with
possibly mentions that \the formal notation has to be very simple, it has to
[be] comprehensible including small details, and it has to be suciently exible
so it can be used in unforeseeable use cases." A participant answering with
probably not states that \specifying a formal model is hard. If you can manage
that, you can also manage the notation."
Summary. 56% of all participants think that making formal notations more
understandable could denitely improve the usage of formal methods. How-
ever, understanding and formalizing systems and requirements in the rst place
remains still a barrier to use formal methods.
6.6.3 Opinions on Using Formal Methods in Real-World Development
With question Q20, we collect the opinions of participants on whether formal
methods are usable in real-world development processes. Possible responseA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 41
follow scale LS5 in Table 2 and could be extended by free-text comments.
While one participant has no opinion , the remaining 40 participants provide
responses shown in Table 15. Predominantly, the answers are positive with
most participants (13, 33%) answering with probably , 11 participants (28%)
with denitely , and ten participants (25%) with very probably . Only one par-
ticipant each answers with neither probably nor possibly and denitely not .
Usability in real-world development processes based on formal methods knowl-
edge. Figure 20 depicts the results of whether formal methods are usable in
real-world development processes considering the participants' knowledge in
formal methods ( cf.Section 6.1.2). Most answers received as free-text com-
ments highlight the interest to use formal methods, however, understanding
and familiarizing with the notations and tools still need to be improved. From
the majority of 13 answers selecting probably , seven participants rated their
knowledge as an advanced beginner . Such a participant highlights that \the
huge WHY NOT in my opinion is the frontloading/enabling. Application of
formal methods usually requires more time in the beginning to become famil-
iar with the formalization method (and maybe tools). Often, representation
is not intuitive on the rst glance and requires a few people who actually
`dig themselves into the problem'. This makes it unattractive for fast appli-
cations/scouting. As soon as you started with another type of analysis in the
beginning, the technical debt still changing to a more formal method becomes
higher and higher. Thus, in my opinion, formal methods can be very helpful

but require a good visualization and explanation as { in the beginning { these
methods are often an investment of time for a later quality return." Further-
more, notably, six of the 11 participants answering with denitely rated their
knowledge as an expert . For instance, such participants see the benets but
also the prerequisites of using formal methods: \[Formal methods] are usable
and can provide a huge benet. However, the necessary competences have to
be created, the management has to support this."
Usability in real-world development processes based on designations. Figure
21 depicts the results of whether formal methods are usable in real-world
development processes grouped by participants' designations (Section 6.1.3).
Among 11 participants answering with denitely , eight participants are sys-
tem/software architects ,systems engineers , and research engineers . An exam-
ple statement from a systems engineer is that \formal methods are already
in use, e. g., in tools like Astree, Polyspace, etc. This only works, if we try
to make it as easy for the user as possible. I don't see people formalizing re-
quirements but, I think if we lower the hurdle this might also change on the
left side of the V." Similarly, eight of ten participants answering with very
probably aresystems engineers ,safety manager/engineers , and research engi-
neers . Averication engineer highlights the necessity of easing the semantics:
\An engineer can make use of such tools only if it serves a user base. Formal
methods oer great metrics to assert real-world processes, however it is limited
today by its very semantic nature. One needs something on top to make this
human understandable." Further, 11 of 13 participants answering with prob-
ably aresystems engineers and safety manager/engineers . Asystem engineer
states that \it is necessary to integrate currently used/recommended methods.
Changes from well known methods at software engineering team must be as
easy as possible."

Apart from the positive opinions, a safety/security expert highlights that
it\depends on what you consider formal methods. Type systems and similar
methods are used heavily by compilers in the background already. Formal spec-
ications in the form of LTL formulas for complex systems seem extremely
challenging from a cost/benet point of view" . All of the participants answer-
ing with possibly consider scalability as the major barrier. For example, a
verication expert states that \scalability, time cost and, required technical
knowledge constitute a barrier to usability." Finally, the only participant an-
swering with denitely not is a safety/security expert who states that \only
a small amount of people will accept it, as too many people are not able to
understand notations used."
Summary. To sum up, 34 out of all 41 participants (83%) have positive opin-
ions regarding the use of formal methods in real-world development processes
(formal methods are denitely ,very probably , and probably usable in such a
context). According to the free-text comments, the main barriers for the ap-
plication of formal methods in the real world are that they are not scalable,
not suitable for all kinds of engineers, not easily understandable, and not in
the state of \plug and play", yet.
7 One-Group Pretest-Posttest Experiment (Part 2): Results and
Analysis
The questionnaire listed in Table 3, gathered from 13 participants, corresponds
toPart 2 of our study, the one-group pretest-posttest experiment. The results
of this experiment are summarized in the following.
7.1 Participants
We collected demographic information about the participants using the ques-
tions DQ1 and DQ2 .
7.1.1 Participants' Experience in Formal Methods
The experience of participants in using formal methods is collected through
question DQ2 (Table 3). Possible answers correspond to scale LS2 (Table 2).
Likewise to Q3in Table 1 ( cf.Section 6.1.1), the participants are asked to
ll-in their experience in formal methods gained individually in academia and
industry as well as their overall experience. Figure 22 shows the responses.
All of the 13 participants have gained experience in formal methods in
academia, industry, or both. Particularly, all participants have academic ex-
perience. Six participants have <1 year and four participants have 4 to <6
years of experience gained in academia. Concerning industrial experience, four44 Kaleeswaran et al.

participants have no experience and ve participants have <1 year of experi-
ence. Finally, focusing on the overall experience, four participants have 1 to
<2 years of experience, and three participants have 2 to <4 years of experi-
ence. Furthermore, two participants each have <1, 4 to<6, and>10 years of
experience.
7.1.2 Participants' Knowledge in Formal Methods
Question DQ1 (Table 3) asks the 13 participants to rate their knowledge in
formal methods (answer according to scale LS1 in Table 2). The responses
of the participants are shown in Figure 23. Similar to the result of Q2in
Part 1 (cf.Section 6.1.2), all participants have rated their knowledge within
the scale novice toexpert while no answers are received for the scale mastery
and practical wisdom . Thus, both mastery and practical wisdom scales will
not be considered for the rest of the discussion. Among the 13 participants,
three participants each rated themselves as novices ,advanced beginners ,com-
petent , and experts while only one participant is rated as procient . Figure
23 depicts the participants' knowledge together with their total experience in
formal methods. All participants having <2 years of experience are rated as
novice and advanced beginners , 2 to<4 years as competent , and 4 to <6 as
well as>10 years as procient and experts .
7.2 Use Case for the Pretest
In this section, we discuss the use case for the pretest, a formally specied
airbag system, that has been presented to the participants, as well as the
collected responses for questions TQ1 and TQ2 (cf.Table 3).A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 45
Figure 23: Participants' knowledge in formal methods, along with their total
experience in formal methods in terms of years.
7.2.1 Airbag System
The component model and specications of the airbag system used in the
pretest are shown in Figure 24. An explanation of the component model and
their corresponding specications were provided in-detail in a video to the
participants. The airbag system consists of one parent component and two
sub-components, CollisionPlausibilation and AirbagController . The behavior
of the parent component is to activate the airbag system via the exploded
signal whenever any of the sensor signals ( senfront,senright,senleft, or
senback) holds. To achieve this, the sub-component CollisionPlausibilation
processes the sensor signals and provides the detection signal collision detected
as output. Finally, the sub-component AirbagController takes the signal colli-
sion detected as input and provides the exploded signal to activate the actuator
of the airbag system.
7.2.2 Diculty of the Use Case and Understanding it
Questions TQ1 and TQ2 (Table 3) assess the participants' diculty and un-
derstanding of the airbag system use case. The participants' responses are
shown in Figure 25 (responses follow scale LS5 in Table 2).
Diculty of the use case. Among 13 participants, 11 participants perceive the
airbag system use case as not dicult by answering within the scale possibly ,
probably not , or denitely not . Figure 26a shows responses for the diculty
of the airbag system use case based on the participants' knowledge in formal
methods ( cf.Section 7.1.2).46 Kaleeswaran et al.

Diculty in understanding the use case. The responses to question TQ2 is
almost similar to those for TQ1 (cf.Figure 25). A majority of participants (9
of 13) rate their understanding of the airbag system use case as not dicult by
answering within the scale possibly ,probably not , ordenitely not . Figure 26b
shows the responses for the diculty of understanding the use case based on
the participants' knowledge in formal methods. Among three participants as
advanced beginners , one participant each answers very probably and probably .
One participant each answering very probably anddenitely not (two extreme
ends) are an advanced beginner and a competent person in formal methods.
Summary. The answers show that most of the participants (11 of 13) perceive
the airbag system as not being a dicult use case. Similarly, understanding
the airbag system use case is also not rated as dicult (9 of 13).A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 47

7.3 Use Case for the Posttest
For the posttest, we use a more complex use case, an electronic power steering
systems. As for the use case in the pretest, we ask the participants questions
TQ1 and TQ2 (cf.Table 3).
7.3.1 Electronic Power Steering System
The Electronic Power Steering (EPS) (Bozzano et al. 2020) system is a Bosch
product designed for highly-automated driving vehicles. It steers either based
on input from the driver or commands from the vehicle bus. The ECU com-
ponent of the EPS system, shown in Figure 27 and used for the posttest, has
two redundant channels: a primary and a secondary channel. Each channel
consists of three modes: master, slave, and passive. The nominal behavior is
that one channel is master and the other one is slave. This synchronization
is taken care of by the sub-component interComDevice in between the pri-
mary and secondary devices. As shown in Figure 27, if torque request from pd
does not hold and torque request topdholds, then the sub-component pri-48 Kaleeswaran et al.

mary device is in master mode. Similarly, if torque request from sdholds and
torque request topddoes not hold, then the sub-component secondary device
is in slave mode. In these two cases, torque is given to the system actuator.
7.3.2 Diculty of the Use Case and Understanding it
As mentioned previously, the same questions TQ1 andTQ2 in Table 3 used in
the pretest are again used in the posttest to collect the participants' opinions
in assessing the diculty of the electronic power steering system use case
and of understanding it. The participants' responses are shown in Figure 28
(answers follow scale LS5 in Table 2). To avoid any bias, we have used a
less complex system for the pretest and more complex real-world project for
the posttest. Thus, our early hypothesis is that a majority of participants
perceives the use case and its understanding of the posttest as more complex.
This is conrmed by the results shown in Figure 28. Overall, the motive of
using the EPS use case for the posttest is to identify whether the proposed
counterexample explanation approach is suitable for real-world systems with
the use of formal methods.
Diculty of the use case. Figure 28 shows that seven out of 13 participants
perceive the EPS use case as dicult by answering with very probably orprob-
ably. One further participant answers with neither probably nor possibly and
the remaining ve participants perceive it as not dicult ( possibly ,probably
not, and denitely not ). Figure 29a groups the responses by the participants'
knowledge in formal methods. Except for the knowledge level competent , all
other knowledge levels predominantly perceive the use case as dicult.
Diculty in understanding the use case. The results for TQ2 on the diculty
of understanding the use case are similar to TQ1 . Seven of 13 participantsA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 49

perceive understanding the EPS system as dicult, one participant answers
with neither probably nor possibly , and the remaining ve participants perceive
it as not dicult. The results are also similar to TQ1 taking the participants'
knowledge levels into account (Figure 29b).
Summary. The results for both the diculty of the EPS use case and of un-
derstanding it are quite similar. The majority of participants (7 of 13) perceive
both the EPS use case and understanding it as dicult.
7.4 Results of the Model Checker and Counterexample Explanation, and
Understanding it
We use questions TQ3 andTQ4 (Table 3) to collect the participants' responses
on understanding the model checker and counterexample explanation results
shown during the pretest and protest to the participants. These results and
responses are discussed in the following.50 Kaleeswaran et al.

Figure 30: Result of the model checker when verifying a renement of the
airbag system.
Model checker output. Figure 30 is the result generated by the model checker
for the airbag system use case described in Section 7.2.1. This result is used
during the pretest. If an inconsistency is identied by the model checker, the
whole violated renement specication and the counterexample to illustrate
the erroneous behavior are shown to the participant. We have highlighted the
inconsistent specications in the whole violated renement specication to
avoid any bias. For example, the model checker output could be hard to inter-
pret on rst glance, which is not necessarily the case for our counterexample
explanation approach since the relevant information is highlighted explicitly.
This could mislead the participant at rst glance in deciding the model checker
output to be too dicult. Thus, to avoid this bias, highlighting the inconsis-
tent specication in the model checker output would trigger the participant
to understand and identify the inconsistency.
Counterexample explanation. The counterexample explanation shown in Fig-
ure 31 is used for the posttest. This explanation is the result of verifying a
renement and explaining a renement inconsistency of the EPS use case ( cf.
Section 7.3.1). Instead of showing the complete violated renement specica-
tion, the explanation presents the type of violation, list of inconsistent speci-
cations, and their corresponding components. Further, instead of a concrete
counterexample, highlighting of erroneous states and variables in the coun-
terexample as well as explanations of the erroneous and expected nominal
behavior are shown to ease the error comprehension for the participants.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 51

Understanding the results. With questions TQ3 and TQ4 , we assess the un-
derstanding of the model checker output and counterexample explanation ap-
proach. Only a minority (6 of 13) of participants perceives the model checker
output as easy to understand (these participants answer with denitely ,very
probably , and probably ), while a clear majority participants (12 of 13) perceives
understanding of the counterexample explanation approach as easy (Figure
32). Notably, no participant answers that understanding the results of the
counterexample explanation approach is hard, while six of 13 participants still
nd the model checker output to be hard to understand (corresponding re-
sponses are possibly and probably not ), even with the less complex use case
(airbag system) and additional highlighting of the inconsistent specications
in the model checker output.
Understanding the results grouped by the participants' knowledge in formal
methods. Figure 33a and Figure 33b show how the participants understand
the model checker output and counterexample explanation based on their
knowledge in formal methods. The understanding of the model checker output
(Figure 33a) aligns with the participants' knowledge. For example, a majority
of the participants answering that understanding is hard ( possibly andprobably
not) are either novice oradvanced beginners . On other hand, a majority of the52 Kaleeswaran et al.

participants answering that understanding is easy ( denitely ,very probably ,
andprobably ) belongs to the competent ,procient , orexpert groups. However,
as shown in Figure 33b, a majority of the participants belonging to the novice
andadvanced beginner groups perceive that understanding the counterexample
explanation is denitely easy.
Summary. The raw output generated by the model checker contains the whole
violated renement specication and the counterexample to illustrate the erro-
neous behavior. The counterexample explanation approach, however, generates
an explanation containing the type of violation, the inconsistent specication,
and their corresponding components. Additionally, erroneous states and er-
roneous variables are highlighted in the counterexample. From the collected
responses, 12 out of 13 participants perceive the understanding of the coun-
terexample explanation result as easy, which contrasts the six out of the 13
participants who perceive the model checker output to be easy to understand.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 53
7.5 Participants Responses for Task-Related Questions
Questions from TQ5 toTQ9 are task-related, in which participants answer
based on their understanding of the model checker and counterexample ex-
planation results. For these questions during the pretest and posttest, the
participants should identify the inconsistent components ( TQ5 ) and speci-
cations ( TQ6 ), the reason for the inconsistency ( TQ7 ), a solution to x the
inconsistency ( TQ8 ), and a nominal behavior of the system in terms of a
correct state transition in place of the erroneous state transition ( TQ9 ).
Identifying inconsistent components. Figure 34a shows the responses to TQ5 ,
which requires from the participants to identify the inconsistent components
based on the model checker result during the pretest and counterexample ex-
planation during the posttest. Eight out of 13 participants identify both the
inconsistent parent and sub-components during the pretest and ten partici-
pants during the posttest. Further three participants each identify either the
sub-component or parent component correctly during both the pretest and
posttest. Notably, no participant completely identies the incorrect compo-
nents based on the counterexample explanation.
Identifying inconsistent specications. Figure 34b shows responses to TQ6 ,
for which participants should identify the inconsistent specication from the
model checker output and based on the counterexample explanation. Among
the 13 participants, four participants have no opinion from the model checker
output. From the remaining nine participants, four participants each iden-
tify the inconsistent specications fully correct and completely incorrect, and
one participant identies parts of the inconsistent specication correctly. Con-
cerning the responses of identifying the inconsistent specications using the
counterexample explanation, nine of 13 participants identify all inconsistent
specications correctly. The remaining four participants identify parts of spec-
ications correctly.

 (b)
Figure 34: Results of identifying (a) inconsistent components and (b) incon-
sistent specications from the model checker output (pretest) and counterex-
ample explanation (posttest).54 Kaleeswaran et al.
Among the ve participants who identify the inconsistent specications
fully or partially based on the model checker output, the responses by four
participants are fully correct in terms of the reason for the inconsistency
(TQ7 ) and the appropriate x ( TQ8 ). On other hand, among 13 participants
who identify the inconsistent specications fully or partially using the coun-
terexample explanation, the responses by 11 participants correctly identify the
reason ( TQ7 ) and by nine participants correctly identify the x ( TQ8 ).
Nominal system behavior in the counterexample. Among the 13 participants,
six participants attempt to answer TQ9 in the pretest and nine participants in
the posttest to identify the expected system behavior in the counterexample,
that is, to name a correct state transition in place of the erroneous state tran-
sition. Among the six participants in the pretest, four participants correctly
name the expected behavior based on the model checker output, while seven
of the nine participants in the posttest correctly name the expected behavior
based on the counterexample explanation.
Summary. A majority of participants identies both the inconsistent compo-
nents and specications correctly based on the counterexample explanation
approach in the posttest, signicantly more than based on the model checker
output in the pretest. This shows that the counterexample explanation is well
suited to identify inconsistent components and specications, and that partic-
ipants are able to explain the reason for and to x the inconsistencies.
7.6 Participants' Opinion on Understanding the Model Checker Output and
Counterexample Explanation
Questions PRQ1 toPRQ4 are used to collect the participants' opinions on un-
derstanding the model checker output during the pretest ( LS6scale). Similarly,
questions POQ1 toPOQ4 are used to collect opinions on understanding the
counterexample explanation during the posttest. Each group of four questions
(PRQ1 toPRQ4 andPOQ1 toPOQ4 ) mainly focus on four aspects: (1) bet-
ter understanding, (2) quicker understanding, (3) condence, and (4) added
value. The responses for these four aspects are shown in Figures 35{38.
Better understanding. Figure 35 shows the results whether the participants
think that the model checker output resp. the counterexample explanation
helps understanding renement inconsistencies. Nine out of 13 participants
answer this question positive ( strongly agree ,agree , and somewhat agree ) with
respect to the model checker output in the pretest. On other hand, all of the
13 participants answer the question positive with respect to the counterexam-
ple explanation in the posttest. Out of these 13 participants, ve participants
each strongly agree and agree , proving that the counterexample explanation
allows participants to better understand inconsistencies of renements.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 55
Figure 35: Better understanding.
Quicker understanding. Figure 36 shows the participants' responses regarding
time saved based on the model checker output in the pretest resp. the coun-
terexample explanation in the posttest. Regarding the model checker output
(pretest), most participants neither agree nor disagree (5 participants). Among
the remaining eight participants, six participants answer positively ( strongly

agree ,agree , and somewhat agree ) and two participants answer negatively
(somewhat disagree ).
Based on the counterexample explanation (posttest), a majority of the par-
ticipants agree that this can save time (7 participants). From the remaining
participants, three participants each answer with strongly agree andsomewhat
agree . No participants answers negatively, which strongly indicates that the
provided counterexample explanation does indeed support a quicker under-
standing of inconsistencies.
Condence of understanding. Figure 37 shows the participants' responses and
depicts whether the output from the model checker or the counterexample
explanation makes participants condent in their understanding of inconsis-
tencies. An equal number of participants (6 participants each) answer either
positively ( agree and somewhat disagree ) or negatively ( somewhat disagree ,
disagree , and strongly disagree ) for the pretest. For the posttest, however,
all participants agree that the counterexample explanation helps to gain con-
dence with ve participants responding strongly agree , ve participants answer-
ingsomewhat agree , and the remaining three participants responding agree .
Minimal added value. Figure 38 shows whether participants believe in an
added value of the model checker output resp. the counterexample explanation
by asking whether they think that the added value is minimal. Seven out of
13 participants answer with disagree for the statement that the model checker
output provides only the minimal added value. Further, only one participant
each answers agree and somewhat agree . For the counterexample explanation,A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 57
Figure 38: Minimal added value.
the largest share of participants (5 participants) disagree s that the explana-
tion only adds minimal value to real-world projects. Further three participants
each somewhat disagree and strongly disagree , two participants neither agree
nor disagree . No participant agrees that the counterexample explanation does
only provide a minimal added value.
Summary. Figures 35{38 show that the participants think that the counterex-
ample approach helps in (1) better and (2) quicker understanding of incon-
sistencies, that it (3) raises their condence in the analysis, and that (4) the
provided value is not minimal. For all four aspects, answers were positive for
the counterexample explanation in the posttest than for the model checker
output in the pretest.
Figure 39: Participants' rating of counterexample explanation features.58 Kaleeswaran et al.
7.7 Rating of Counterexample Explanation Features
Questions FQ1 toFQ6 are designed to collect the participants' opinions on
the dierent features of the counterexample explanation approach (possible
responses follow scale LS7). The responses are shown in Figure 39. Notably,
all provided features are rated positively ranging from good toexceptional . No
participant rated any feature negatively, that is, to be fair,poor, orvery poor .
In Figure 39, the rst four features correspond to explaining the violated spec-
ication. The last two features correspond to explaining the counterexample.
The three features regarding highlighting the erroneous sub-parts in the in-
consistent specication (feature #3 in Figure 39), listing the component name
of the corresponding inconsistent specications (feature #4), and highlighting
the erroneous state in the counterexample (feature #6) were rated particularly
helpful, each with eight participants answering either exceptional orexcellent .
7.8 Feedback
Questions FE1 toFE8 are used to collect feedback from the participants on the
counterexample explanation approach and using formal methods. Suggestions
and responses are discussed in the following.
7.8.1 Comparison of Understanding Inconsistencies
With question FE1, we asked the participants for feedback according to scale
LS5 whether it is easier to understand the inconsistencies with the counterex-

ample explanation approach than based on the original model checker output.
From the 13 participants, the largest share with six participants answer with
denitely , further ve participants with probably (Table 16). Figure 40 shows
the results grouped by the participants' knowledge in formal methods.
A majority of participants answer that understanding inconsistencies is eas-
ier with the counterexample explanation than with the original model checker
output. Only one participant answers slightly hesitant ( possibly ).
7.8.2 Challenges in Analyzing Inconsistencies
With question FE2, we want to identify challenges that participants see in ana-
lyzing inconsistencies based on the counterexample explanation approach (an-
swers as free-text comments). Nine out of 13 participants provided responses.
Among them, four participants state that the main challenge in understanding
stems from the complexity of the EPS system specications and components.
Further three participants state that the main challenge stems from not using
formal methods frequently in their daily work. An example statement from a
participant is the following: \I think, the second example is much more com-
plicated. As I did not work with formal specications within the last 5 years,
it was hard to get into the topic." . The remaining two participants highlight
that it is still hard to x the issues despite the counterexample explanation:
\Highlights and explanation do not provide a solution to the issue so the chal-
lenge to identify the root cause in the specication and removing it in a way
to expresses the intended behavior still remains a challenge. But the approach
helps to identify the root cause."

7.8.3 Maintaining Renement Consistency
With question FE3, we collect feedback according to scale LS3on whether it is
easier to maintain the renement consistency during a renement step with the
counterexample explanation approach. A majority of the participants answers
positively (Table 17). Two participants answer with extremely easy , six with
easy, four with slightly easy , and one with neither hard nor easy . Figure 41
shows the results based on participants' knowledge in formal methods.
7.8.4 Counterexample Explanation in Real-world Development
With question FE4, we collect feedback according to scale LS5 from the par-
ticipants on whether the proposed counterexample explanation approach is us-
able in the real-world development processes. Twelve participants provided re-
sponses. According to Table 18, a majority of participants (5) vote for probably ,
with ten participants in total answering positively ( denitely ,very probably ,
and probably ). Figure 42 shows the participants' opinions on using the coun-
terexample explanation approach in real-world development based on their

7.8.6 Counterexample Explanation in Your Project
With question FE6, we collect feedback from the participants according to an-
swer scale LS5 on whether engineers prefer to use the proposed counterexam-
ple explanation approach in their real-world projects. Four participants have
no opinion and the remaining nine participants provided feedback (Table 20).
Among these nine participants, ve participants answer negatively ( possibly ,
probably not , and denitely not ), and four participants answer positively ( def-
initely ,very probably , and probably ). These answers contrast the previously
discussed feedback questions FE1 toFE5 where responses are more positive
while for FE6, the majority of participants answer negatively. The reason for
this negative rating as mentioned by the majority of participants are the cur-
rently used development processes and tools that do not t well with formal
methods or the counterexample explanation approach.

7.8.7 Further Improvements
The motive of questions FE7 andFE8 are to collect suggestions for further im-
provement of the counterexample explanation approach. Question FE7 mainly
focuses on collecting participants' feedback on whether providing a list of pos-
sible solutions/xes would be helpful for engineers. This feedback is collected
according to answer scale LS5.FE8 is an open question that allows partici-
pants to suggest further improvements as free-text comments. The responses
toFE7 are shown in Table 21. Most of the answers are positive, meaning that
providing a list of possible solutions/xes would be helpful to participants.62 Kaleeswaran et al.

With question FE8, we collected general suggestions from the participants.
We received eight responses that suggest improvement for using the counterex-
ample explanation approach. A majority suggests to provide training to use
formal methods, and improve or develop the visualization of the explanation
by associating and integrating it with the tools used within Bosch, e. g., IBM
Rhapsody and DOORS Next Generation (DNG).
8 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the ndings of the two user study phases following
the research questions and points to be investigated ( cf.Section 5.1).
8.1 RQ1 { Challenges in Identifying Inconsistent Specications
Research question RQ1 gathers challenges in identifying inconsistent formal
specications that are introduced during the renement of a system.
Understanding formal notations is dicult for engineers. Formal methods
may play a crucial role on the left-hand side of the V-model (Weber 2009),
where systems engineers and safety manager/engineers are mainly involved,
to avoid major aws in early design decisions. In our user survey Phase 1, 20
of 41 participants are system engineers and safety managers/engineers (Sec-
tion 6.1.3). The majority of them perceives understanding of formal notations
as hard to some degree ( cf.Section 6.2). Additionally, we noticed that the
complexity of understanding depends on years of experience in using formal
methods. Results further show that introducing formal methods to engineering
teams with little experience in formal methods is challenging.
Identifying inconsistent specications is dicult for engineers. Results in Sec-
tion 6.3 clearly show that a majority of Phase 1 participants perceive the
identication and understanding of inconsistent specications as hard to some
degree and that it consumes signicant time. Results are similar for maintain-
ing and verifying the renement consistency (Section 6.4).
Qualitative statements by the participants note that identifying and un-
derstanding of inconsistent specications highly depends on the size of the
system and the number of its requirements. These statements emphasize the
question whether the usage of formal methods for industrial system and atA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 63
industrial scale is possible. For example, the automobile sector is now devel-
oping systems that are quickly expanding in size and complexity as a result
of highly automated driving. System and requirements are not only complex
but also frequently changing, for instance, due to security demands.
Our initial expectation was that more of our participants perform man-
ual inspections/reviews rather than using automated tools like model checker ,
simulators , and reasoners in their development projects. Thus, our hypothe-
sis is that a majority of participants will answer that identifying inconsistent
specications and understanding is very complex. However, on the contrary, a
majority of participants use model checkers (Section 6.3.5). Even though a ma-
jority uses automated tools like model checkers , a majority still answers that
the identication and understanding of inconsistent specications are hard. A
reason for this might be the complexity of verication tools and their gener-
ated results, raising the need to make them more user-friendly to be used by
engineers without having in-depth knowledge of formal methods.
8.2 RQ2 { Benet of Formal Methods to Development Processes
RQ2 gathers insights on whether the identication of inconsistent specica-
tions and usage of formal methods are benecial to real-world development
processes.
Using formal methods can make the system safer. Functionalities of automo-
tive systems increase expeditiously, resulting in more (safety) requirements to
avoid any unintended behavior. Thus, performing safety analysis early on the
left-hand side of the V-model (Weber 2009) is crucial to help reducing the num-
ber of errors identied later during the validation. A majority of participants
agrees that formal verication can make the system safer and be a benet to
the functional safety ( cf.Section 6.5 and Section 6.6). Although a majority
of the participants have a positive opinion on using formal verication, based
on the qualitative answers from the participants, there is a discussion whether
formal verication is usable and scalable to real-world systems. Specically,
a majority participants indicate that the usage of formal methods could be
improved by making formal notations easier to understand ( cf.Section 6.6.2).
Identifying inconsistent specications is benecial in real-world development
processes. Eliciting requirements, rening requirements, and developing sys-
tem architectures are the initial steps in the V-model (Weber 2009). Thus, re-
quirement elicitation and renement of those requirements are crucial as they
serve as a basis for further system development and safety analysis. Errors
and inconsistencies introduced in these early phases, identied only in later
development stages, become costly and may lead to catastrophic events. There
is a high possibility that most safety-critical errors are identied late during
the validation phase in industry (Pohl and Rupp 2011). Therefore, to identify
errors in the requirements during the initial stages performing manual reviews64 Kaleeswaran et al.
(e. g., inspections) does not seem to be sucient or an ecient approach. This
motivates the usage of automated methods like formal verication and simu-
lation to help identifying errors in requirements and overcoming challenges of
manual reviews. Although a majority of participants answers that using and
understanding formal verication are complex, the majority agrees that iden-
tifying inconsistent formal specications is benecial for safety analysis and
makes a system safer ( cf.Section 6.5.3).
8.3 RQ3 { Easing the Use of Formal Methods
Insights for RQ3 are drawn from Phase 2, the one-group pretest-posttest exper-
iment. RQ3 gathers insights whether engineers prefer to use formal methods
(model checkers particularly) if the diculty for understanding verication
results to identify inconsistent specications is reduced, in particular with the
counterexample explanation approach.
The counterexample explanation approach eases the comprehension when com-
pared to the interpretation of the raw model checker output. Six of 13 participants
of the one-group pretest-posttest experiment answer that they understand the
verication result generated by the model checker for the airbag system (Sec-
tion 7.4). Our initial hypothesis was that by proving an additional user-friendly
counterexample explanation, it would be easier for engineers to understand the
error as well as that it can ease the usage of formal methods among engineers.
Indications for this are already drawn from Part 1 , where a majority answers
that making formal notations easier to understand can improve the usage of
formal methods (Section 6.6.2). Finally, the results discussed in Section 7.4
support this hypothesis, as a stark majority of 12 of 13 participants prefer the
counterexample explanation compared to understanding the model checker
output. In summary, improving the usability and understandability aspects of
formal notations can promote the use of formal methods.
Additionally, the results collected for the four aspects of a better under-
standing, quicker understanding, condence of understanding, and added value
(cf.Section 7.6) validate this hypothesis, as the counterexample explanation
improves all four aspects compared to the raw model checker output presented
otherwise to engineers.
It is possible for engineers to identify and x inconsistent specications based
on the counterexample explanation approach. Apart from collecting the par-
ticipants' opinions , we can also rely on the experiment, which let participants
perform tasks for the provided use cases. The results presented in Section 7.8.1
evaluate the dierence of correct and incorrect answers in nding inconsistent
components between pretest and posttest and shows only a minor dierence
between working with raw results and the counterexample explanation.
However, this is not the case for the identication of inconsistent specica-
tions. With the raw model checker output, only ve of 13 participants identifyA User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 65
either fully or partially correct the inconsistent specications. While with the
counterexample explanation, nine of 13 participants were able to identify the
complete set of inconsistent specications and also correctly explained the
reason of the inconsistency by understanding the explanation. This strongly
shows that a counterexample explanation can indeed improve the error com-
prehension and providing such an explanation can promote the use of formal
methods among engineers.
The counterexample explanation approach can promote formal verication and
usage of model checking in real-world development processes. From the col-
lected responses, a majority of participants have a positive opinion as a coun-
terexample explanation could support maintaining renement consistency, could
be usable in real-world development process, and could be used while using
formal methods ( cf.Section 7.8). These results clearly indicate that a coun-
terexample explanation approach could be one possible way along with other
possible options like property specication patters to improve the usability as-
pects of formal methods. However, for the question whether the participants
are interested to use the counterexample explanation approach in their project,
the response is contradictory where only a minimal number of participants are
interested to use it. A major challenge mentioned by the participants is that
tools currently used in their projects do not support integrating the proposed
counterexample explanation approach. This shows that integrating the exist-
ing verication tools with industrial tools needs to be one of the prime focus to
improve the usage of formal methods. Nevertheless, such an integration cannot
be achieved easily since larger organizations such as Bosch typically use dif-
ferent tools for dierent projects. Thus, focusing on adaption and integration
of each tool individually is not a trivial task.
9 Threats to Validity
In this section, we discuss threats that might jeopardize the validity of our
study results as well as on measures we take to reduce these threats. We
consider threats to validity as discussed by Wohlin et al. (2012), Kitchenham
and Peeger (2008), and Campbell and Stanley (1963). In the following, we
structure them according to construct, internal, and external validity.
Construct validity. The prime threats to construct validity are related to the
completeness of the questionnaire and in phrasing questions in a way that is
understood by all participants in the same way. To mitigate these threats, we
have considered the following steps in our research method: (i) we incorporated
feedback from two senior engineers having background in formal methods and
model checking, (ii) we incorporated feedback regarding unbiased questions
from a psychologist, and (iii) we performed a pilot test with ve research
engineers to check for completeness and understandability.66 Kaleeswaran et al.
Internal validity. The critical internal threat to be considered for the user
survey is the selection of participants. Since we followed snowball sampling for
the participant selection, there could be a possibility of several participants
working in the same project, which could bias the nal result. Therefore, we
considered at most rst four participants from each project and neglected
further project members.
We consider threats to internal validity listed by Campbell and Stanley
(1963) for the pretest-posttest experiment. To mitigate the history and mat-
uration threats, we performed the posttest experiment within fteen days
following the pretest experiment. The most severe threats to be considered
in this experimental design are testing and instrumentation . Those threats
arise because participants get overwhelmed with the intervention including the
fact that we have developed the counterexample explanation approach. Conse-
quently, participants could answer more positively in the posttest experiment
than the actual value due to the intervention. To mitigate these threats, par-
ticipants conduct the study anonymously and we explicitly emphasized to the
participants that the obtained study results would serve as a reference in the
future to use our counterexample explanation approach for real-world projects
at Bosch. Additionally, to avoid overwhelmed responses and accept only valid
responses, we have added the task questions TQ1 {TQ9 (Table 3); And the re-
sponse is accepted as valid only if the participant attempted to answer at least
some part of these questions. Further, to reduce biasing between the pretest
and posttest experiment, the use case of an airbag system (a toy example)
used in the pretest is signicantly less complex than the use case of the Bosch
EPS system used in the posttest. However, to adjust the diculty level of the
systems used for the experiment, we used feedback from the pilot study with
ve research engineers. Basically, adjustment of diculty is done by increasing
or decreasing the number of components and size of the specications which
have to be understood by the participants.
Finally, another internal threat is to present the model checker's raw output
with the inconsistent specication highlighted by us to the participants in the
pretest. This could bias the participants' opinions that the model checker's
output included the highlighted parts is easier to interpret than it actually
is in practice where the highlighted parts are not available. As such, we can
rather expect larger benets of our counterexample explanation approach in
practice than we observed it in the one-group pretest-posttest experiment.
External validity. To avoid polluting results, we do not force the participants
to select an option from an answer scale for every question. For example, the
participants could choose the option No Opinion , which supports in achieving
actual results. However, the participants have the choice to enter a reason as a
qualitative statement if they do not want to select any option. One of the severe
drawbacks of the one-group pretest-posttest experiment is its generalization.
However, the benet of our study is that we used a real-world EPS system for
the posttest experiment, and the participants are professional engineers who
work on real-world automotive projects at Bosch.A User Study for Evaluation of Formal Verication Results 67
10 Conclusion
Our user study was designed to i) identify the motivation, challenges, and
applicability of formal methods in industry and ii) evaluate if the proposed
counterexample explanation approach matches the identied challenges.
To identify the motivation, challenges, and applicability of formal methods
in industry, we conducted an extensive survey with 41 participants of various
business units and disciplines within Bosch as a rst phase of the user study.
Responses show that the majority of the participants is positive regarding the
use of formal methods in real-world development processes. However, partici-
pants identify that incomplete formal models in industry, understanding for-
mal notations, as well as understanding verication results, e.g., produced by a
model checker, still remain a challenge for adoption of formal methods in prac-
tice. Identifying renement inconsistencies gets more complex with the system
getting more complex and the number of requirements increasing. Apart from
understanding and scalability challenges, one of the major challenge in using
verication tools is a lack of training for engineers.
As a second part of the user study, we performed a one group pretest-
posttest study with 13 participants of various Bosch business units to evaluate
if the proposed counterexample explanation approach is capable of support-
ing the use of formal methods in industry. Results from the experiments as
well as collected opinions from participants prove that the approach helps in
i) better understanding and ii) quicker understanding inconsistencies, that it
iii) raises their condence in the analysis, and that iv) it provide value for the
development of safety-critical projects in industry.
As researchers and educators in formal methods, we should strive to make
our notations and tools accessible to non-experts. { Clarke and Wing (1996)
Future directions. To leverage formal methods in real-world development pro-
cesses, one of the most suitable means is to provide education and training
in formal methods. On the one hand, universities can teach the foundations
of formal methods to students ( e. g., temporal logics). On the other hand,
companies can teach the skills required in the specic industrial context ( e. g.,
considering the domain and tooling) to people entering industry as well as
upskill existing employees to understand the foundations of formal methods.
By providing education structured training in formal methods either in uni-
versities or companies, hesitancy in using formal methods could be reduced
and the benets of formal methods could be reaped.
Looking at the results of evaluating our counterexample explanation ap-
proach, it is clear that understanding of verication results is easier with a
counterexample explanation than with the direct output of model checker. In
future, similar explanations need to be generated for dierent model checkers,
domain-specic system models and requirements, as well as integrated with
project-specic tool chains. Furthermore, instead of only providing explana-
tions that illustrate the error, providing suggestion to x those errors could68 Kaleeswaran et al.
help to improve the agility to perform verication iteratively and thus, to
support round-trip engineering.
