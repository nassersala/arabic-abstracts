## Paper Impact

ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics) is one of the most influential papers in database systems. It has been implemented in major commercial database systems including:
- IBM DB2
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Many others

The paper has received thousands of citations and established the standard approach to transaction recovery in modern database management systems.
