## Historical Significance

Bigtable is one of the foundational papers in distributed systems and NoSQL databases. Published at OSDI 2006 and awarded Best Paper, it introduced the wide-column store model that influenced numerous systems including Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, and Google Cloud Bigtable. The paper demonstrated how to build a flexible, high-performance storage system capable of handling diverse workloads at massive scale (petabytes of data across thousands of servers).

The paper has been instrumental in shaping modern cloud database architectures and is considered essential reading for computer science students studying distributed systems.
