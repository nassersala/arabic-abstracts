## Paper Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in distributed systems. It introduced:
- **Lamport Clocks**: Logical timestamps for ordering events
- **Happened-before relation**: Fundamental concept in distributed systems
- **Total ordering of events**: Using logical clocks to create consistent global ordering
- **Physical clock synchronization**: Bounds on clock drift

**Awards:**
- 2000 PODC Influential Paper Award (Dijkstra Prize)
- 2007 ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award
- Over 13,000 citations

This paper laid the foundation for understanding causality and time in distributed systems.
