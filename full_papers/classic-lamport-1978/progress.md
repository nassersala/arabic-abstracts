## Translation Notes

This paper is foundational to distributed systems and introduces several key concepts:
- The "happened-before" relation (→)
- Logical clocks (Lamport timestamps)
- Total ordering using logical clocks
- Physical clock synchronization algorithm
- Distributed mutual exclusion

The paper contains mathematical notation that must be preserved exactly.
