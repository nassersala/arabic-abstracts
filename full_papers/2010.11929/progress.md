## Notes

This is an extremely influential paper that brought transformers to computer vision. It is the foundation for:
- CLIP, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
- Modern vision-language models
- State-of-the-art image classification

High quality translation (≥0.85) is essential given the paper's foundational importance.

## Translation Strategy

1. Focus on main sections (1-5)
2. Appendices are optional but may be included if valuable
3. Preserve all mathematical notation
4. Maintain consistency with established glossary terms
5. Back-translate critical technical descriptions
