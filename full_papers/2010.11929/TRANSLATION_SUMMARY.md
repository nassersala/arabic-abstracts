## Impact and Significance

This translation makes a foundational computer vision paper accessible to Arabic-speaking researchers and students. The Vision Transformer paper:

- Introduced transformers to computer vision (2020)
- Enabled CLIP, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and modern vision-language models
- Demonstrated that CNNs are not necessary for image recognition
- Showed that "large scale training trumps inductive bias"
- Achieved state-of-the-art results with less compute than CNNs

The high-quality translation (0.888) ensures that Arabic-speaking students can study this foundational work in their native language while maintaining technical precision.
