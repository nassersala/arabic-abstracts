1 Introduction
This paper is about three 2-categories which sit an an intersection o f algebra,
model theory and geometry (the last in the broad sense).
Oneofthesecategories, ABEX, hasforits objectstheskeletallysmallabelian
categories and for its morphisms the exact functors; another, DEF, is the cat-
egory of deﬁnable additive categories and interpretation functor s; the third is
the category, COH, of locally coherent Grothendieck categories and coherent

morphisms. In each case the 2-arrowsare just the natural tran sformations. The
(anti-)equivalences between these were described in [45], which build s on [43]
and [30], and are recalled below (see also [34] and [25] for analogous re sults).
Here these categories and their connections are explored furthe r.
I have tried to include enough explanation of background to make th e paper
accessible to a variety of readers; for more details one should cons ult the various
referencescited. I will use [42] as a convenientreference since it g atherstogether
much of what I will need but [23], [29], [43] also contain much of that.
Throughoutthispaper,categoriesare,bydefault, preadditive, functormeans
additive functor, ( A,B) will denote the category of additive functors from the
(usually skeletally small) preadditive category Ato the (usually at least addi-
tive) categoryB,Abwill denote the category of abelian groups, Mod- Awill
be an alternative notation for ( Aop,Ab) (whereopdenotes the opposite of a
category) - it is the category of right A-modules - andA-Mod = (A,Ab) will
denote the categoryofleft A-modules. The full subcategoryofﬁnitely presented
modules is denoted by mod- A. We write PREADD for the 2-category of pread-
ditive categories (additive functors and natural transformation s). We scarcely
distinguish between a skeletally small category and a small version of it (i.e. a
category to which it is equivalent but which has just a set of objects ).
Now we show how the three 2-categories are related, then give a qu ick sum-
mary of what is in each section.
Theorem 1.1. [45, 2.3 and comments following] There is a diagram of equiv-
alences and anti-equivalences between ABEX,COHandDEFas follows.

Explicitly:

We will need the details of these (anti-)equivalences, so here they a re.
FromABEXtoDEF: to a skeletally small abelian category Awe associate
the deﬁnable category Ex( A,Ab) - the full subcategory of A-Mod on those
functors which are exact; to an exact functor F:A→B, we associate the
functorF∗: Ex(B,Ab)→Ex(A,Ab) which is just precomposition with F.
FromDEFtoABEX: to a deﬁnable category Dwe associate the category,
fun(D) = (D,Ab)→/producttext
, of functors from Dwhich commute with direct limits
and direct products (we write fun- Rin the case that D= Mod-R); to an
interpretation functor, that is, a functor I:C→Dwhich commutes with direct
products and direct limits, we associate the functor I0: fun(D)→fun(C) which
is precomposition with I.

Between ABEXandCOH(on objects): to a locally coherent Grothendieck
categoryGwe assign its full subcategory, Gfp, of ﬁnitely presented objects;
in the other direction, to a skeletally small abelian category Awe assign the
category Lex(Aop,Ab) of left exact functors on Aop, thus right exact functors
onA, so this includes the representable functors ( −,A) forA∈A. This is
a locally coherent Grothendieck category and the image of Aunder the just-
mentioned Yoneda embedding A/mapsto→(−,A) is equivalent to the full subcategory
of ﬁnitely presented objects (see 4.1, also for the identiﬁcations L ex(Aop,Ab)≃
Flat-A≃Ind(A)).
Between ABEXandCOH(on morphisms): from a morphism f∈Ex(A,B)
we deﬁne the coherent morphism (see Section 4) ( f∗,f∗) :H= Ind(B)→
Ind(A) =Gwhich has f∗:H= Lex(Bop,Ab)→Lex(Aop,Ab) =Gjust
precomposition with fopand hasf∗= Ind(f). In the other direction we take
a coherent morphism ( f∗,f∗) to the restriction of the left adjoint, f∗, to the
ﬁnitely presented objects of G.
The as-yet-unexplained notation Abs( G) refers to the full subcategory of
absolutely pure (orfp-injective ) objects ofG- those objects Gsuch that
Ext1(Gfp,G) = 0.
The next result, which is not diﬃcult to show (or see [44]), is one instan ce of
this picture. ByA(R) we denote the smallest abelian (not necessarily full) sub-
category of Mod-Rwhich contains mod- R(see [45,§6], also Section 2.4 below).
By/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htwe denote the smallest deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- RcontainingX.
Proposition 1.2. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R)op,Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tAbs-R/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so Abs-Ris a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod-R, then
Ex((mod -R)op,Ab)≃Abs-R.
Note the duality which applies to the whole picture described above. I t is
obvious for ABEX, on which it is the 2-category equivalence which takes each
abelian category to its opposite. It follows that there is a correspo nding self-
equivalence on each of the other two categories (which will be descr ibed in the
relevant section). In the context of the model theory of deﬁnab le subcategories
of module categories this duality was found ﬁrst for pp formulas, an d termed
elementary duality ([39]) then extended to the category of pp-pair s and the
Ziegler spectrum in [22]. In an algebraic form it is in [5] and [21].
For instance, the dual to the result above is the following.
Proposition 1.3. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R),Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tR-Flat/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so A(R) = mod-RandR-Flatis a deﬁnable subcategory
ofR-Mod, then
Ex(mod-R,Ab)≃R-Flat.
In Section 2 we identify the ﬁnitely presented objects of ABEXas the ﬁnite
type localisations of free abelian categories of ﬁnitely presented rin gs and we
3

--- Page 4 ---

show that every small abelian category is a direct limit - “directed colim it” in
the more category-theoretic terminology - of such categories. S inceABEXalso
has directed colimits in a suitable 2-category sense we could therefo re say that
ABEXis ﬁnitely accessible (in some 2-category sense). We show that ABEX
has pullbacks and also characterise the monomorphisms (and say a lit tle about
the epimorphisms) of this category.
The main result of Section 3 is that the structure of DEF- arrows and 2-
arrows as well as the objects - is essentially determined by the full s ubcategories
of pure-injective objects. We also show that if Ais skeletally small abelian then
Ex(A,D) is deﬁnable for any deﬁnable Grothendieck (so, 3.6, locally ﬁnitely
presented) category D(not just whenD=Ab).
Section 4 is devoted to developing an additive version of things (cohe r-
ent morphisms, classifying toposes, points) that are familiar in the c ontext of
toposes. The parallel is well-known but we develop it further here as part of the
larger additive picture.
2 The category of small abelian categories and
exact functors
The category ABEX, of skeletally small abelian categories and exact functors,
belongs to algebra but it has a model-theoretic meaning (its objects are the
categoriesof pp-sorts and pp-deﬁnable functions for the corre spondingdeﬁnable
categories, see [43, Chpt. 22] or [42, Part III], also [44]). It can als o be seen as
generalising the category of rings through the free abelian catego ryconstruction
but also through a possibly more geometric construction (see Sect ion 2.4.2).
Recall that an exactfunctorF:A→B between abelian categories is a
functor such that if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is an exact sequence in Athen
0→FA′→FA→FA′′→0 is an exact sequence in B. By the kernelof such a
functor we mean the full subcategory ker( F) on the objects{A∈A:FA= 0}
which are sent to 0 by F. This is a Serre subcategory ofA, meaning a
full subcategorySofAwhich is closed under subobjects, quotient objects and
extensions: otherwise said, if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is exact then A∈S
iﬀA′,A′′∈S. Conversely every Serre subcategory Sis the kernel of an exact
functor fromA. Alocalisation ofAis an exact functor F:A→Bwhich
is such that the image of Fis full and includes an isomorphic copy of every
object inB; that is, up to equivalence Bis the image of F. We deﬁne the
quotient category ofAat the Serre subcategory Sto have the same objects
asAbut deﬁne the morphisms from AtoBinA/Sto be equivalence classes of
morphisms from subobjects A′ofA, withA/A′∈S, to factor objects B/B′of
B, withB′∈S, under a natural (eventual agreement) equivalence relation. Se e,
for instance, [49, §IX.1], for details but the idea is simply that one forces the
objects inSto become zero. If F:A→Bis a localisation then Bis equivalent
toA/ker(F) andFhas a right adjoint which is a full, though not in general
exact, embedding iofBinA. Thus the image of iis a reﬂective subcategory
ofA. We write/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htfor the Serre subcategory generated by a collection Xof
objects ofA. We also write Ser( A) for the set of Serre subcategories of A.
We will need the following theorem, the ﬁrst paragraph of which is [16, 4.1]
(for fuller references see [42, §10.2.7] or [43,§4]).

Theorem 2.1. LetRbe a skeletally small preadditive category. Then there is
an additive functor ifromRto a skeletally small abelian category Ab(R)such
that ifα:R→Bis any additive functor to an abelian category Bthen there
is a factorisation through ivia a unique-to-natural-equivalence exact functor
Ab(R)→B.

The category Ab(R)may be identiﬁed with (R-mod,Ab)fp≃/parenleftbig
(mod-R,Ab)fp/parenrightbigop
and the embedding itakes an object PofRto((P,−),−)and has the then ob-
vious action on morphisms.
Corollary 2.2. IfRis a skeletally small preadditive category then Ab(Rop)≃
Ab(R)op.
The category Ab( R), more precisely the functor R→Ab(R), given by 2.1
is thefree abelian category onR. In the case that we start with a ring R,
that is a preadditive category with one object ∗Rwhich has endomorphism ring
R, the image of that object in Ab( R) is the representable functor (( ∗R,−),−)
on the representable functor ( ∗R,−)∈R-mod (this latter being the projective
left module RR).
Note that, taking B=Aband allowing αto roam over all (covariant) func-
tors, i.e. leftR-modules, weobtainthat R-Modisequivalent toEx(Ab( R),Ab).
ReplacingRbyRopto get the contravariant form, and noting 2.2, we have
Mod-R≃Ex(Ab(R)op,Ab).
If a ringRis von Neumann regular then Ab( R)≃mod-R, indeed these
are exactly the rings for which this is true (see, e.g., [42, 10.2.38] (wh ere the
statement is missing anop)).
2.1 Categorical properties of ABEX
IfA,B∈ABEXthen Ex(A,B) is a skeletally small category with objects the
exact functors from AtoBand with morphisms the natural transformations
between these. It isa preadditivecategory: for F,G∈Ex(A,B) the set (F,G) =
Nat(F,G) of natural transformations from FtoGis an abelian group with
0∈Nat(F,G) being given by 0 A= 0 :FA→GAfor each object A∈Aand,
ifτ,µ∈Nat(F,G) thenτ−µis deﬁned at A∈Aby (τ−µ)A=τA−µA:
FA→GA. Indeed, Ex(A,B) is additive: for a zero object, choose a zero object
0B∈Band deﬁne the functor 0 : A→BbyA/mapsto→0Bfor allA∈A. And if
F,G∈Ex(A,B) then we may, since Bhas ﬁnite direct sums, deﬁne F⊕Gby
takingA∈AtoFA⊕GAandf:A→A′to(Ff,Gf) :FA⊕GA→FA′⊕GA′.
ThusABEXmay be seen as a category enriched in additive categories.
Example 2.3.(A,B) need not be abelian.
LetRbe right coherent, so mod- R∈ABEXand Ex(mod- R,Ab)≃R-Flat,
the category of ﬂat left R-modules (see 1.3). In particular Ex(mod- Z,Ab)≃
Z-Flat (∗) and, we claim, Ex(mod- Z,mod-Z)≃Z-Flat∩Z-mod =Z-proj, the
category of ﬁnitely generated projective Z-modules, which is not abelian. To
5

--- Page 6 ---

see the claim we just use that in the equivalence ( ∗) a ﬂat module Mon the
right-hand side of the equivalence acts on mod- Zas the (exact) functor −⊗M;
it is clear that if such a functor outputs only ﬁnitely presented value s thenM
is ﬁnitely presented, and conversely.
Bearing in mind that ABEXis a 2-category, so equality is generally replaced
by natural equivalence, we will say that an exact functor F:A→BinABEX
is amonomorphism if for allG,H:A′→Aifτ:FG→FHis a natural
isomorphism then there is a natural isomorphism η:G→Hsuch thatτ=Fη.
Lemma 2.4. For everyA∈ABEXandA∈Athere is a morphism Ab(Z)→A
inABEXsuch that the single object, ((∗Z,−),−), of the image of ZinAb(Z)
(2.1) is taken to A(and hence the ring, Z, of endomorphisms of ∗Zis taken to
its natural image in End(A)).
Proof.Deﬁne thefunctor bytaking ∗=∗ZtoA(andextending1 Z= id∗/mapsto→idA
to a ring homomorphism) and then we have an extension to an exact f unctor
(unique to natural equivalence) Ab( Z)→Aby 2.1. /square
Lemma 2.5. IfF:A→Bis a monomorphism in ABEXthenFis full on
isomorphisms in the strong sense that if g:FA1→FA2is an isomorphism then
there is an isomorphism f:A1→A2such thatFf=g. This second condition
onFis equivalent to Fbeing faithful and every isomorphism g:FA1→FA2
being the image of some morphism A1→A2.
Proof.Suppose that A1,A2∈Aand thatg:FA1→FA2is an isomorphismin
B. LetGi: Ab(Z)→Abe as in the lemma above, taking ∗=∗ZtoAi; then, by
2.1, we deduce that there is a natural isomorphism τ:FG1→FG2essentially
determined by τ∗=gso, by assumption, there is a natural isomorphism η:
G1→G2, in particular an isomorphism η∗:A1→A2, such that Fη∗=g, as
required.
For the equivalent condition, recall that a functor Fisfaithful if whenever
f,f′:A1→A2are in its domain and Ff=Ff′thenf=f′. In the case of
an additive functor, one replaces the pair f,f′byf−f′,0 and the condition
becomesFf= 0 implies f= 0. In the case that Fis an exact functor between
abelian categories then, since F(co)ker(f) = (co)ker( Ff), one deduces that F
is faithful iﬀ the object kernel is zero, that is iﬀ FA= 0 implies A= 0. So
ifFreﬂects isomorphism , meaning that FA1≃FA2impliesA1≃A2then
Fis faithful. For the converse, if g:FA1→FA2is an isomorphism then, by
assumption, there is a morphism f:A1→A2withg=Ff. If either ker( f)
or coker(f) were non-zero then, by exactness and faithfulness of F,Ffwould
have a non-zero kernel or cokernel, contradiction. So fis an isomorphism. /square
Proposition 2.6. The following are equivalent for a morphism F:A→Bin
ABEX:
(i)Fis monic in ABEX;
(ii)Fis full on isomorphisms in the strong sense of 2.5
(iii)Fis faithful and full on isomorphisms.
Proof.(i)⇔(ii) One direction is the lemma above. For the other suppose that
Fis full on isomorphisms in the strong sense and that we have G,H:A′→A
6

and a natural equivalence τ:FG→FH. So for each A′∈A′we have an
isomorphism τA′:FGA′→FHA′; by assumption there is an isomorphism
which we will denote ηA′:GA′→HA′such thatFηA′=τA′. We have to show
that theηA′ﬁt together to form a natural transformation from GtoH.

which commutes, that is F(Hf.ηA′−ηA′′.Gf) = 0, so it will suﬃce to show that
the kernel of Fin the sense of arrows is zero. But we have this from (the proof
of) 2.5, which also gives us the equivalence of (ii) and (iii). /square
So a monomorphism in ABEXis, in particular, an embedding of an abelian
(i.e. exact) subcategory and any such embedding which is full (e.g. t he embed-
ding of the category of ﬁnite abelian groups in the category of ﬁnite ly generated
ones) is a monomorphism.
Example 2.7.A monomorphism in ABEXneed not be a kernel.
LetRbe a tame hereditary ﬁnite-dimensional algebra, set B= mod-Rand
letAbe the full, abelian, subcategory of regular modules. Then A→Bis a
morphism in ABEXand is a full embedding so certainly is a monomorphism
inABEX. If it were the kernel of an exact functor then Awould be a Serre
subcategory - not so since RRembeds in a regular module and so the Serre
subcategory generated by Ais all ofB.
Example 2.8.A monomorphism in ABEXneed not be full. Consider the non-
full functor F: mod-k→mod-kA2, whereA2is the quiver•→•, which takes
kkto thekA2-modulekA2. IfP,Qare in the image of F, that is, are ﬁnitely
generated free kA2-modules, then it is easily computed that any isomorphism
P→Qis in the image of F. So, by 2.6, Fis a monomorphism in ABEXbut
clearlyFis not full.
Example 2.9.Consider the functor mod- kA2→mod-kwhich takes a represen-
tationV1αV−−→V2of the quiver A2toV1⊕V2and which has the obvious action
on morphisms (i.e. takes ( f1,f2) tof1⊕f2). This functor is clearly exact and
faithful but is not full on isomorphisms hence is not a monomorphism in ABEX.
Say thatF:A→BinABEXis anepimorphism if whenever G,H:B→C
aresuchthat thereisanaturalequivalence τ:GF→HFthen thereisanatural
equivalence µ:G→Hsuch thatµF=τ.
Example 2.10.A morphism F:A→BinABEXwith/a\}bracketle{tFA/a\}bracketri}ht=Bneed not be
an epimorphism.
LetF: mod-(k×k)→mod-kA2be the functor which takes ( V1,V2) to the
representation V10− →V2ofA2and consider the functors Id ,G: mod-k[A2]→
7

--- Page 8 ---

mod-kA2whereGtakes a representation W1α− →W2toW10− →W2. BothFand
Ghave the obvious deﬁnitions on morphisms. It is easily checked that t hese
functors are exact and clearly GF= Id.Fbut there is no natural equivalence
Id→G, soFis not an epimorphism.
On the other hand, each of the two simple representations k→0 and 0→k
ofA2is in the image of Fso, since every object of mod- kA2has ﬁnite length,
the Serre subcategory of mod- k[A2] generated by the image of Fis all of the
category.
We do not have a characterisation of epimorphisms in ABEX, but note the
following.
Proposition 2.11. (1) IfA ∈ABEXandS ∈Ser(A)then the canonical
localisation functor π:A→A/Sis an epimorphism in ABEX.
(2) IfF:A→Bis an epimorphism in ABEXthen the Serre subcategory, /a\}bracketle{tFA/a\}bracketri}ht,
generated by FAisB.
Proof. (1) IfG,H:A/S →Bare such that there is a natural equivalence
τ:Gπ→Hπthen forA∈Awe have an isomorphism τA:GπA→HπA. Since
we may regardA/Sas having objects those of A(but diﬀerent morphisms)
we can deﬁne η:G→Hto have component ηπA=τAatπA. It must be
checked that this is well-deﬁned and that these components coher e to form a
natural transformation. Both come down to showing that if f:πA→πA′
thenHf.τA=τA′.Gf. Butf≃πgfor someg:A1→A′

2.2 Pullbacks in ABEX
We showthat ABEXhas pullbacks, hence a notion of“basechange”(see Section
2.4.2).
Given a diagram
A
F
/d15/d15
BG/d47/d47C
inABEX, we construct the following category P. The objects of Pare triples
(A,B,γ) whereAis an object ofA,Ban object ofBandγ:FA→GB
is an isomorphism in C. A morphism from ( A,B,γ) to (A′,B′,γ′) is a pair
(f:A→A′,g:B→B′) such that γ′.Ff=Gg.γ.
FA
Ff
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB
Gg
/d15/d15

Clearly this gives a category and we have the obvious functors F′:P→B
andG′:P→Awith, for instance, G′taking (A,B,γ) toAand taking ( f,g)
tof. We also have the natural isomorphism FG′⇒GF′with component γat
(A,B,γ), which is a 2-arrow of ABEX. We show thatPis abelian, that F′and
G′are exact and that we have constructed a pullback for the diagram inABEX.
Lemma 2.12.Pis an abelian category and F′,G′are exact.
Proof. We deﬁne addition of morphisms as follows: given ( f,g),(f′,g′) :
(A,B,γ)→(A′B′,γ′) we have the commutative diagrams
FA
Ff
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB

Ff′
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB
Gg′
/d15/d15
FA′
γ′/d47/d47GB′
and henceγ′(Ff+Ff′) =Gg.γ+Gg′.γ= (Gg+Gg′)γ, so deﬁne ( f,g)+(f′g′)
to be (f+f′,g+g′). In this way we have a preadditive category.
It is easy to check that ( A⊕A′,B⊕B′,γ⊕γ′) is the (co)product of ( A,B,γ)
and (A′,B′,γ′) inP.
Given (f,g) : (A,B,γ)→(A′,B′γ′) we have the exact sequences 0 →
ker(f)→Af− →A′→coker(f)→0 and 0→ker(g)→Bg− →B′→coker(g)→0.
SinceFandGare exact these give exact sequences 0 →Fker(f) = ker(Ff)→
FA→FA′and similarly for Gand for the cokernel sequences. Then it is easily
checked that (ker( f),ker(g),γ0) whereγ0is the restriction/corestriction of γ,
is the kernel of ( f,g) and the description of the cokernel is dual. In particu-
lar, (f,g) is a monomorphism, respectively epimorphism, iﬀ both fandgare.
Showing that every monomorphism is a kernel and every epimorphism a cok-
ernel is similar. This also gives the description of exact sequences in P, from
which it is obvious that F′andG′are exact. /square
Theorem 2.13. ABEXhas pullbacks.

Proof.We show thatPconstructed above is the pullback of the diagram we
started with. So suppose that we have a diagram
D

/d28/d28H
/d34/d34
PG′/d47/d47
F′
/d15/d15A
F
/d15/d15
BG /d47/d47C
and a natural isomorphism τ:FH→GK. Then we deﬁne L:D→P by
taking an object Dto (HD,KD,τ D) and taking a morphism f:D→D′to
(Hf,Kf), noting that the diagram
FHDτD/d47/d47
FHf
/d15/d15GKD
GKf
/d15/d15
FHD′
τD′/d47/d47GKD′
commutes. It is quickly checked that this functor ﬁlls in the diagram ( with
even strictly commuting triangles) and its uniqueness (to natural is omorphism)
follows using the deﬁnitions of F′andG′. More precisely, if we also have
L′:D→P and natural isomorphisms η:H⇒G′L′,η′:K⇒F′L′then
forD∈D,L′Dhas the form ( G′L′D,F′L′D,δD) whereδD=Gη′
DτD(FηD)−1
(let us ﬁx, because we actually have a cone over the whole diagram, t he arrow
fromDtoCto beGK). So we have a natural isomorphism from LtoL′with
component at DtakingLD= (HD,KD,τ D) toL′D= (G′L′D,F′L′D,δD) by
the pair (ηD,η′
D).
In the 2-categoricalcontext, the notion ofpullback (and more ge neral limits)
usually requires more, namely we must show that if we have two such c ones at
Dover the initial diagram, say

which are pullbacks in this sense, hence with natural isomorphisms η:H⇒
G′L,η′:K⇒F′Landζ:H′⇒G′L′,ζ′:K′⇒F′L′, and if we have a

2.3ABEXis ﬁnitely accessible
We show that ABEXis, in some 2-category sense, ﬁnitely accessible. That is,
we show that there is a set of ﬁnitely presented objects such that each object
ofABEXis a directed colimit of copies of these objects. There is a variety of
notionsofdirected colimit in the 2-categoricalcontext, depending on the levelat
which diagrams are required to commute, as opposed to commute up to natural
isomorphisms and so our statement refers to a particular interpre tation of the
words “ﬁnitely accessible”.

There is a corresponding notion of directed colimit which, cf. the pro of of
2.13, has a clause involving modiﬁcations. In the next result we use th at but it
will be seen that, for our main result, we are able to simplify matters b y using
strictly directed diagrams.
By acoconeon such a directed system we mean an object A, arrows (fλ∞:
Aλ→A)λand natural isomorphisms ( θλµ:fµ∞fλµ⇒fλ∞/parenrightbig
λ<µsuch that
θλµθµν=θλν. This is a direct limit (ordirected colimit ) of the system if,
given any cocone/parenleftbig
B,(gλ:Aλ→B)λ,ζλµ:gµfλµ⇒gλ/parenrightbig
, there ish:A→B
and there are natural isomorphisms ηλ:hfλ∞⇒gλwithηλθλµ=ζλµηµfor all
λ<µ, plus a clause involving modiﬁcations which we will not spell out here.
Proposition 2.15. The 2-category ABEXhas colimits of weakly directed dia-
grams.
Proof.Suppose we are given a weakly directed system/parenleftbig
(Aλ)λ∈Λ,(fλµ:Aλ→
Aµ)λ<µ,(φλµν:fµνfλµ⇒fλν)λ<µ<ν/parenrightbig
as above. We deﬁne the category A
which will be the colimit, as follows.
Fortheobjectsof Awetaketheequivalenceclassesofobjectsof/uniontext

the equivalence relation ∼generated by setting Aλ∼fλµAλ. So this identiﬁes
fλνAλandfµνfλµAλwheneverλ < µ < ν . Therefore Aλ∼Aµiﬀ there are
λ0=λ,λ1,...,λn=µand objects Aλ0=Aλ,Aλi∈Aλi,...,Aλn=Aµwith,
foreachi, eitherλi<λi+1orλi+1<λiandcorrespondingly Aλi+1=fλiλi+1Aλi
orAλi=fλi+1λiAλi+1. Note that in this case if ν >λ0,...,λnthen the objects
fλνAλandfµνAµare objects inAνwhich are isomorphic by a sequence of
componentsofsomeofthe φijkand theirinverses(depending onachoiceof“zig-
zag” between AλandAµ). We continue to use the obvious subscript notation
to indicate which category an object lies in.
12

--- Page 13 ---

Similarly we deﬁne an equivalence relation ∼on arrows to be that generated
by settingg:Aλ→Bλto be equivalent to fλµgfor allµ > λand by setting
1Aλto be equivalent to the component of φλµνatAλfor allAλandλ<µ<ν .
The arrows from Aλ/∼toBν/∼are the equivalence classes of arrows from
someAµ∈Aλ/∼to someBµ∈Bν/∼.
To deﬁne composition of such arrows it is suﬃcient to consider the ca se of
arrowsg:Aλ→Bλandh:Bµ→CµwhenBλ∼Bµ. Using notation as
above for a zig-zag between BλandBµ, chooseν > λ 0,...,λnand note that
the objects fλνBλandfµνBµare connected by a sequence, ksay, of forward
images of components of the φρστand their inverses - arrows in the equivalence
class of the identity map of the object Bλ/∼. We deﬁne the composition to be
fµνh.k.fλνg.
Ithastobecheckedthattheresultisabelian,thattheobvious fλ∞:Aλ→A
are exact (that is clear), and that Ahas the universal property including the
modiﬁcations clause. Checking that Ais abelian may be done by using that,
given any ﬁnite diagramin A, one may chooserepresentativesofthe objects and
arrows in it and then ﬁnd a single Aνin which there is an actual diagram of
the same sort which represents the original one. The directed colim it property
may be shown by arguing rather as in the proof of 2.16 below. /square
Although we use a weak notion of directed system and directed colimit in
ABEXwe will now see that if we have a directed colimit in the category Rng
of rings then this induces a diagram of associated free abelian categ ories which
even has strictly commuting compositions, that is, with fµνfλν=fλν, hence
with eachφµνλbeing the identity. We do this by choosing speciﬁc copies of
free abelian categories, as follows (this will refer to the connection s with model
theory, for which see, e.g., [42]).
Suppose that f:R→Sis a morphism of rings. If φis a formula (treated
as a string of symbols) in the language of R-modules then we deﬁne f∗φto be
the formula in the language of S-modules which is obtained by replacing each
occurrence of (the function symbol corresponding to) an elemen t ofRby (the
function symbol corresponding to) its image in S. It is a result of Burke ([8,
3.2.5]; see, e.g., [42, 10.2.30]) that the free abelian category can be re garded (up
to equivalence of categories) as having objects the pairs, φ/ψ, of pp formulas
and having equivalence classes of certain pp formulas as its morphism s. Clearly
f∗immediately gives a map from the objects of Ab( R), so deﬁned, to Ab( S); it
also gives a map on morphisms - given a morphism in Ab( R) fromφ/ψtoφ′/ψ′
we choose a representative formula ρwhich deﬁnes it and then, one may check,
f∗ρdeﬁnes a map from f∗φ/f∗ψtof∗φ′/f∗ψ′which, again, one may check (for,
if formulas are equivalent on R-modules then they are equivalent on S-modules
regarded as R-modules), is independent of choice of representing formula ρ. In
this wayf, throughf∗, induces what is clearly a functor, let us denote it Ab( f),
from Ab(R) to Ab(S). We said this for rings but all of it applies equally for
small preadditive categories R,Sin place ofRandS.
The point of this construction is that if we are also given a homomorph ism
g:S→Tthen Ab(g)Ab(f) = Ab(gf) - equality, not natural isomorphism.
Therefore, given a (directed) diagram ∆ in Rng, we have a (directed) diagram
“Ab(∆)” in ABEXwhere any commutativity relations in the original diagram
∆ are replaced by strict commutativity relations between the corre sponding
functors; we will use the term strictly directed for such directed diagrams.
13

This will allow us, at least for our considerations, to keep things simple , though
in a way which, no doubt, is not actually necessary.
Proposition 2.16. Suppose that R= lim−→RλinRng, more generally, suppose
R= lim−→Rλis a strict colimit of a strictly directed diagram in PREADD . Then
Ab(R) = lim−→Ab(Rλ)inABEX(and, if appropriate choices of copies of the
Ab(Rλ)are made, this may be taken to be a strict direct limit).
Proof.(We prove it for rings, the modiﬁcations for the more general case being
minor. Also, to keep the notation natural, we write Rfor the single object
of the ring Rregarded as a 1-point category.) The fλµ:Rλ→Rµinduce
Ab(fλµ) : Ab(Rλ)→Ab(Rµ) which, as we have seen above, may be taken
to form a strict directed system in ABEX. Similarly we may take a strictly
commuting cocone on this diagram formed by the Ab( fλ∞) : Ab(Rλ)→Ab(R),
wherefλ∞:Rλ→Rare the maps inRngto the direct limit. We claim that
this is a directed colimit in ABEX.
So suppose that we have B∈ABEXand for each λan exact functor gλ:
Ab(Rλ)→Bsuch that for each µ > λthere is a natural isomorphism ρλµ:
gµAb(fλµ)→gλsuchthatthesecoheretomakeacoconeontheAb( −)diagram;
in particular ρµνρλµ=ρλν. The canonical embeddings Rλ→Ab(Rλ), when
composed with the gλ, give objects gλRλofBwhich are linked by the strictly
directed system of isomorphisms (( ρλµ)(Rλ))−1:gλRλ→gµRµ. We choose
and ﬁx some λ∈Λ, setS=gλRλand note that the ( ρλµ)Rλ(gµ↾Rµ) form
a (strictly commuting) cocone in Rngfrom the family ( Rµ)µ≥λtoS, where
gµ↾Rµdenotes the ring homomorphism from RµtogµRµinduced by gµ. Hence
there is an induced morphism, h0, fromRtoS. We have to extend this to an
exact functor h: Ab(R)→Bwhich will form a cone (in the 2-category sense)
on the directed system (Ab( Rµ))µ.
We note that the images of the ρλµform a strictly cohering (as µvaries)
system of objects and arrows of Bwhich, together, form a copy of Ab( S) and
which, by our previous speciﬁc construction of Ab( R) as a direct limit of the
Ab(Rµ), induce, viathegµ(then theρλµ) an (exact) functor h, extending h0,
from Ab(R) to this copy of Ab( S) and thence toB. This functor his, by this
construction (admittedly, hardly in the spirit of 2-category theor y), such that
hAb(fµ∞) =gλand so we obtain the statement of the theorem. /square
Corollary 2.17. Given a skeletally small preadditive category Rlet{Rλ}λbe
the directed system of its full subcategories with ﬁnitely m any objects. Then
Ab(R) = lim−→Ab(Rλ). IfS ∈Ser(Ab(R))thenAb(R)/S= lim−→Ab(Rλ)/Sλ
whereSλ=S∩Ab(Rλ).
Proof.First replaceRby a small category to which it is equivalent, so that
we have a directed system over a set. Then note that this directed system
inPREADD is strictly directed (by inclusions) and has Ras its strict direct
limit so, by 2.16, we have the ﬁrst assertion. Similarly, and making use o f the
observations before 2.16, we obtain the second statement. /square
Lemma 2.18. EachA ∈ABEXis equivalent to Ab(R)/Sfor some small
preadditiveRand some Serre subcategory SofAb(R).
14

--- Page 15 ---

Proof. To see this we may, for example, set D= Ex(A,Ab) - a deﬁnable
category, hence a deﬁnable subcategory of some Mod- R. ThenAis a quotient
of fun(Mod-R) = Ab(R)opby some Serre subcategory. /square
Corollary 2.19. IfA∈ABEXthenA≃lim−→Aλwhere each category Aλis

Proof. By 2.18,Ais equivalent to some Ab( R)/Sand, by 2.17, Ab( R) =
lim−→Ab(Rλ)whereeachRλhasjust ﬁnitelymanyobjectsandhenceisequivalent
to a ringRλ(with Ab(Rλ)≃Ab(Rλ))./square
When using this result we will typically write A= lim−→Aλin line with our
use of “=” between categories to mean naturally equivalent.
We will say that a category A∈ABEXisﬁnitely presented if whenever
we have a directed system/parenleftbig
(Bλ)λ∈Λ,(gλµ:Bλ→Bµ)λ<µ,(φλµν:gµνgλµ⇒

and an exact functor h:A→Bthere is a factorisation through the directed
system in the sense that there is λ,hλ:A→Bλand a natural isomorphism
η:h⇒gλ∞hλfor some some λ. Note that this then induces a family of arrows
hµ=gλµhλ:A→Bµand a coherent(using the φλµν) familyθ−1

of natural equivalences. Write ABEXfpfor the full sub-2-categoryon the ﬁnitely

as above and suppose that we have h: Ab(R)→B,
hence, writing Rin place of∗R,R→Ab(R)→ Bwith image R′, say, in
B. We may (e.g. see the proof of 2.15) replace Bwith an equivalent subcat-
egory where every object and arrow is in the image of some gλ∞so we may
assume that R′is the image, gλ∞B0for some object B0of some chosen and
then ﬁxedBλ. Deﬁne the directed system in Rng(the objects being regarded
as one-point preadditive categories) with index set {µ:µ≥λ}and which, at
µ > λhas the object fλµB0and, forµ < νhas the functor/ring homomor-
phism (φλµν)B0gµν:gλµB0→gλνB0. That this is a directed system in Rng
follows from the coherence condition on the φin the deﬁnition of directed sys-
tem. SinceB= lim−→Bλ, the direct limit of this system is (isomorphic to) R′.
SinceRis ﬁnitely presented this functor R→Btherefore factors through the
system at some fλµB0and then that map induces hλ: Ab(R)→Bλwhich lifts
h: Ab(R)→Bthrough the system in the sense described in the deﬁnition of

The composition of R→BλwithBλ→Binduces an exact functor Ab( R)→B
which must be equivalent to the given functor from Ab( R) toB.
SinceS=/a\}bracketle{tS/a\}bracketri}htand Ab(R)→A→B sendsSto 0, there is µ≥λsuch that
the compositeS→Ab(R)→Bλ→Bµis 0 and so there is A→Bµas shown
making the square commute.
The composites R→Ab(R)→A→B andR→Ab(R)→Bλ→Bµ→B
agree up to isomorphism on Rand so Ab( R)→A→B and Ab(R)→Bµ→
Bare, by 2.1, naturally equivalent; both have kernel S, so they induce an
equivalence between A→BandA→Bµ→B, as required. /square
ThusABEXhas a set of objects which are ﬁnitely presented and such that

2.4 Abelian categories as schemes
The replacement of a ring by its free abelian category and the role th at small
abelian categories play, as categories of imaginaries, in the model th eory of
additive structures ([42], [43], [44]), strongly suggest the heuristic that small
abelian categories are a generalisation of (some aspects of) rings. This, espe-
cially in view of the connection with Ziegler and rep-Zariski spectra (e .g., [42],
[45]), in turn suggests developing some additive version of the theor y of schemes
withABEXplaying the role of the category of commutative rings and the cat-
egoryAbreplacing the category of sets in the functor-of-points approac h (and
with the associated presheaves of abelian categories - see, e.g. [45 ] - being the
analogues of varieties and schemes).
In fact, there seem to be two natural ways of embedding the cate gory of (all
unital) rings into this context. One is viathe free abelian category construction
(see 2.1) but the resulting “geometry” is really that of the represe ntation theory
ofthering, ratherthan thatoftheringitself. An embeddingthatp erhapsbetter
reﬂects classical algebraic geometry is obtained by taking a ring RtoA(R) - the
smallest abelian subcategory of Mod- Rwhich contains the category of ﬁnitely
presented modules; in this case, however, it seems that we should r estrict ring
morphisms to be the ﬂat ones, and we do lose information, see below.
16

--- Page 17 ---

We now make the obvious deﬁnitions but must point out that the notio n
of “aﬃne” scheme in this context is unclear, for instance since many non-aﬃne
schemes, such as the projective line can already be found as the as sociated
geometry of a category in ABEX.
2.4.1 The functor of points view
Recall that if Z= Spec(R) is an aﬃne scheme then by a scheme over Zone
means a morphism X→Zof schemes. If Xis aﬃne, say X= Spec(S), then
this is equivalent to a morphism R→Sin the category of (commutative) rings.
If we are thinking of ABEXas a generalisation of the category of commutative
rings and if we assume that any reasonable embedding of the latter c ategory in
the former is covariant, then it seems reasonable to say that a scheme over
A∈ABEXis a morphism f:A→BinABEX. By the anti-equivalencebetween
ABEXandDEFwecan extend the terminology, by sayingthat an scheme over
C= Ex(A,Ab) is a morphismD= Ex(B,Ab)→C. In model-theoretic terms
this is a coherent way of interpreting in each D∈DsomeC-structure.
Forexample,amorphism f:R→SofringsinducesanexactfunctorAb( f) :
Ab(R)→Ab(S) and the corresponding morphism of deﬁnable categories is just
the induced restriction-of-scalars functor Mod- S→Mod-Rwhich clearly ﬁts
the description of being a coherent way of interpreting an R-module in each
S-module.
An alternative view of a morphism X→Zof schemes is that it is an X-
point ofZ, so we may extend that terminology also, saying that a morphism
A→BinABEXis, as well as a scheme over A, aB-pointofA. The collection
ofB-points ofA, being just Ex(B,A), has a natural structure of an additive
category.
A particularly important case is where A= Ab(Z) is the free abelian
category of Z. A scheme over Ab( Z) is an exact functor Ab( Z)→ Bto a
small abelian category. By 2.1 and since Zhas just the one object, and since
there is no choice about where to send the endomorphisms of that o bject, a
B-point of Ab( Z) is simply an object of B. The corresponding morphisms
of deﬁnable categories are just the functors in DEFfromD= Ex(B,Ab) to
Ex(Ab(Z),Ab) =Aband we know that the category of these is fun( D) =B.
That is, a scheme over Ab( Z) is just a pp-pair (in the theory of some deﬁnable
additive category) and the collection of B-points of Ab( Z) is the category B
itself (in this case an abelian category though we have already noted , 2.3, that
Ex(A,B) is not in general abelian).
This also suggests the view that ﬁxing Ais ﬁxing an abelian language and
then a functor from a deﬁnable category to Ex( A,Ab) is a generalised pp for-
mula, picking out not just a single abelian group (and by implication its as soci-
atedimaginarysorts)butaﬁxedcollectionofsortsandmapsbetwe enthem(and
their associated sorts). Then a morphism D= Ex(B,Ab)→C= Ex(A,Ab) in
DEFis an interpretation of an (exact) A-structure in each (exact) B-structure.
2.4.2 Rings to Abelian Categories
We describe two ways of embedding the category Rngof rings, more generally
the 2-category PREADD of skeletally small preadditive categories, into ABEX.
For simplicity, we will deal just with rings (usually we think of Rngas an
17

ordinary category but if f,g:R→Sare homomorphisms of rings then a
natural transformation/2-arrow from ftogis just a homomorphism from S
regarded as an R-module viaftoSregarded as an R-module viag.)
Theﬁrstisthefree-abelianweak2-functorAb( −),whichtakesR∈PREADD ,
to its free abelian category Ab( R) (composing with duality also gives the con-
travariantversion, taking Rto Ab(R)op). The correspondingdeﬁnable category
is Ex(Ab(R)(op),Ab)≃R(op)-Mod whose (rep-Zariski) spectrum is in general
much larger than any notion of Spec( R). So, while that embedding is a natural
one, it seems not to be the geometrically natural one (unless we res trict to, say,
the subcategory of injectives). Nevertheless, it is there and pro bably should be
seen as describing an embedding of the representation theory of a ring rather
than the geometry of a ring.

A possibly better embedding of algebraic geometry per seis the replacement
ofRbyA(R) (which, in the case that Ris right coherent, is just the category
mod-R). In the casethat Ris commutative noetherianthis is equivalent, viathe

primes and indecomposable injectives), to considering Spec( R). It turns out,
however, that R/mapsto→A(R) is functorial only if we restrict to ﬂat morphisms
between rings. There is also the issue that this process seems not t o capture
closed subschemes - just the reduced variety (though this is not s urprising since
we are capturing only Spec( R)).
Using that Ex(Ab( R),Ab)≃R-Flat (1.3) we have the following. Recall
from [45,§6] thatA(R) = (R-mod,Ab)/{F:F(RR) = 0}.
Proposition 2.23. Iff:R→Sis a homomorphism of rings then this induces,
viaAb(f)in the representation of A(R)as a quotient category of Ab(R), an
exact functorA(f) :A(R)→A(S)iﬀS∈/a\}bracketle{tRR/a\}bracketri}htthat is, iﬀ RSis fp-ﬂat in the
terminology of [20]. In particular if RSis ﬂat thenA(f)is an exact functor
and, ifRis right coherent, then this condition is also necessary.
Proof.ForF∈Ab(R), Ab(f)F(SS) =F(RS) which will be 0 for all such Fiﬀ
RS∈/a\}bracketle{tRR/a\}bracketri}ht. ThusRS∈/a\}bracketle{tRR/a\}bracketri}htiﬀ Ab(f)ZR⊆ZS(whereZRdenotes the Serre
subcategory of functors which annihilate the module R)./square
IfRis right coherent, so A(R) = mod-R, then the functor A(f) is just
MR/mapsto→M⊗RSS. For, since RSis fp-ﬂat and every R-module inA(R) is ﬁnitely
presented, that functor is exact; also the two functors agree o nRR, taking it
toSS; therefore, by exactness, these functors agree on (project ive presentations
of) ﬁnitely presented modules. Indeed, by [19, 3.1] (and 2.22) this d escription
ofA(f) is valid for any ring R.
In fact, and somewhat explaining this (in view of 1.2) we have the follow ing.
Proposition 2.24. Iff:R→Sis a homomorphism of rings then the re-
striction of scalars functor Mod-S→Mod-RtakesInj-StoInj-RiﬀRSis
ﬂat.
Proof.Iffis ﬂat then for NRandMS, Ext1

so, ifMSis injective then so is MR.
For the converse we use that a module MRis ﬂat iﬀ Hom Z(M,Q/Z) is an
injectiveR-module (e.g. [49, I.10.5]). In particular SRis ﬂat iﬀ Hom Z(S,Q/Z)R
is injective, so, if restriction of scalars preserves injectives then SRis ﬂat. /square
That is, attempting to use A(R) in place of Ab( R) is no more than using
Ab(R) then trying to restrict to Inj- R.nonredsch

This shows that the second embedding does not capture all the geo metry we
would wish; the ﬁrst embedding does preserve all the structure bu t in general
represents much more than the geometry of which Ris the coordinate ring.
3 The2-category of deﬁnableadditive categories
A category is deﬁnable if it is equivalent to a deﬁnable subcategory of
a module category Mod- R, meaning a full subcategory which is closed under
direct products, direct limits and pure subobjects.
19

--- Page 20 ---

Examples include, as well as module categories, the ﬁnitely accessible addi-
tive categories with products; in particular locally ﬁnitely presentab le (in the
terminology of [1], [18]) additive categories are deﬁnable. So both the category
of torsionfree and the category of torsion ( sic) abelian groups are deﬁnable.
Any deﬁnable subcategory of a deﬁnable category is deﬁnable. The category
of injective abelian groups is deﬁnable but has no non-zero ﬁnitely pr esented
object. The book [42] is, in part, a compendium of examples of these .
Those are the objects of DEF; the morphisms are those functors which com-
mute with direct products and direct limits (equivalently, see [43, §25], the
model-theoretic interpretation functors). These categories we re originally stud-
ied in the context of the model theory of modules (see [50], [40]), as t hose
subclasses of module categories which are axiomatised by implications between
ppformulas; theywerefocussedonandnamedbyCrawley-Boevey ([13]). Infact
they arise in a variety of contexts and, as seen in 1.1, they may be (r e)presented
in diverse ways.
Recall that fun(D) denotes the skeletally small abelian category ( D,Ab)→/producttext
and that in case D= Mod-Rthis category, which we also write as fun- R, is
equivalent to (mod- R,Ab)fp. In [42,§12.3], fun(D) was deﬁned vialocalisation
from the caseD= Mod-Rand here we are using the main theorem, 12.10, of
[43] to deﬁne it as above directly from D. There is a natural correspondence,
viaannihilation, between deﬁnable subcategories of Dand Serre subcategories
of fun(D).
Theorem 3.1. ([23],[29]; see, e.g., [42, 12.3.20]) If D′is a deﬁnable subcate-
gory of the deﬁnable category DandSD′={F∈fun(D) :FD= 0for allD∈
D′}denotes its annihilator in fun(D)thenSD′is a Serre subcategory of fun(D)
and the quotient category fun(D)/SDis, in a natural way, naturally equivalent
tofun(D′). Every Serre subcategory of fun(D)arises in this way.
We restate part of 1.1 for convenience of reference.
Theorem 3.2. Suppose thatDis adeﬁnable category; then D≃Ex(fun(D),Ab).
Suppose thatAis askeletally small abelian category, then A≃fun/parenleftbig
Ex(A,Ab)/parenrightbig
.
In one direction, the ﬁrst equivalence takes an object DofDto evD, the
evaluation of F∈(D,Ab)→/producttext
atD. Thedescription of the other direction of
that equivalence is less canonical because there are many ways in wh ich the
objects ofDmay be regarded; for instance, R-modules may be presented in the
usual 1-sorted way but may alternatively be regarded as left exac t functors on
(mod-R)op(viathe restricted Yoneda embedding Mod- R→((mod-R)op,Ab)
given byM/mapsto→(−,M)↾mod-R) or as exact functors on fun- R(in model-
theoretic terms this is making various choices of language for the st ructures in
D). In any case, we may represent Das a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- Rfor
some preadditive R(whereR= fun(D) would be the canonical choice) and
then fun(D) is a localisation of fun- R= Ab(Rop) so then, given F, an exact
functor on fun(D), we deﬁne the corresponding object D, as a functor from Rop
toAb, as taking an object PinRtoF((−,(−,P))D) where (−,(−,P))Dis
the localisation of the representable functor ( −,(−,P))∈Ab(Rop) at the Serre
subcategory,SD. (The second equivalence is, in each direction, just evaluation.)
IfD= Ex(A,Ab) then the ( elementary )dualcategory ofDisDd=
Ex(Aop,Ab) and we have fun( Dd) = (fun(D))opwhich we denote by fund(D).

is in [21] and [5] (at least for Ra ring). The classical (retrospective) example,
apart from the right and left module categories, is the duality, see e .g. [42,
3.4.24], for Ra right coherent ring, between Abs- R(the absolutely pure right
modules) and R-Flat (the ﬂat left modules).

LetDbe a deﬁnable category. A monomorphism in Dispureif some ul-
trapower of it is split. The pure monomorphisms thus intrinsically deﬁn ed are
the restrictions to Dof the pure monomorphisms in Mod- R(these can be char-
acterised in many ways) whenever Dis embedded as a deﬁnable subcategory.
An objectD∈Dispure-injective if it is injective over the pure monomor-
phisms inD. Denote by Pinj( D) the full subcategory of pure-injective objects
ofD; it is coﬁnal inDin the sense that every object D∈Dpurely embeds in
a pure-injective object, indeed Dhas a unique-to-isomorphism-over- Dminimal
such extension, termed its pure-injective hull and denoted H(D).
Letpinj(D) denotethesetofisomorphismclassesofindecomposable(thisex-
cludes 0) pure-injective objects of D(it is indeed a set). The Ziegler topology
on pinj(D) has, for a basis of open sets, the sets ( F) ={N∈pinj(D) :FN/\e}atio\slash= 0}
asFranges over fun(D). Therep-Zariski topology on pinj(D) has for a
basis of open sets the [ F] = (F)c={N∈pinj(D) :FN= 0}. These spaces
are denoted Zg(D) and Zar(D) respectively. In the case that D= Mod-R, re-
spectivelyD=R-Mod, we write ZgR, respectively RZg, and similarly for Zar.
There are many equivalent ways to deﬁne these topologies and much is known
about them, for which I refer to [42]. And, of course, use of the na me “Zariski”
indicates a generalisation of that spectrum (see [41, p. 200ﬀ.] or [42 ,§§14.1,
14.4]). Here is the basic connection with deﬁnable subcategories.
Theorem 3.4. (see e.g. [42, 5.1.4, 12.4.1]) Let Dbe a deﬁnable category. The
deﬁnable subcategories of Dare in natural bijection with the closed subsets of its
Ziegler spectrum Zg(D), indeed each deﬁnable subcategory is generated as such
by the indecomposable pure-injectives in it.
The bijection takes D′∈Sub(D) to its intersection with pinj( D) - itssup-
port- and, in the other direction, takes a subset of Zg( D) to the deﬁnable
subcategory that it generates.
Also associated to Dis the locally coherent Grothendieck category which
can be obtained as follows: if Dis a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- Rthen we
know that fun(D) = (mod-R,Ab)fp/SD. The Serre subcategory SDgenerates a
hereditarytorsiontheory ofﬁnite type onthe locallycoherentGro thendieckcat-
egory (mod-R,Ab) (see, e.g., [42,§11.4]) and the localisation, (mod- R,Ab)D,
of (mod-R,Ab) at this torsion theory is a locally coherent Grothendieck cate-
gory-wedenoteitFun( D) -andwehave(Fun( D))fp= fun(D). Thesecategories
are considered in Section 4.1.
Remark 3.5.The category Fun( D) can also be obtained directly as ( D,Ab)→.
To see this we consider ﬁrst the case that D= Mod-Rand hence that Fun( D) =
21

--- Page 22 ---

(mod-R,Ab); then the equivalence of this category with those functors from
Mod-RtoAbwhich commute with direct limits, and hence which are deter-
mined by their actions on mod- R, is easily seen (and essentially in [4]). In the
general case,Dis a deﬁnable subcategory of some module category Mod- Rand
Fun(D) is the localisation of Fun- Rdescribed above. But the action of the lo-
calisation of F∈Fun-Ris just restriction of its action from Mod- RtoD. Since
direct limits inDagree with those in Mod- R, it follows that any F∈Fun(D)
does commute with direct limits. For the converse, if F∈(D,Ab)→then it
will be enough to show that Fhas an extension to a functor on Mod- Rwhich
commutes with direct limits (since then Fwill be the localisation of this exten-
sion and hence in Fun( D)). But by, e.g. [14, 2.4], any deﬁnable subcategory of
Mod-Ris contravariantly ﬁnite=precovering in Mod- R(as well as covariantly
ﬁnite - see, e.g. [42, 3.4.42]) and so its left Kan extension exists and will, being
left adjoint to restriction, commute with direct limits, as required.
3.1 An intrinsic deﬁnition of deﬁnable category?
We have two, equivalent, deﬁnitions of the notion of deﬁnable categ ory: as a
deﬁnable subcategory of a categoryof R-modules; as the categoryof exact func-
tors on a small abelian category A. Both are, however, deﬁnitions in terms of
somerepresentation,andalthoughwecangivesomesortof“intrin sic”deﬁnition
of “deﬁnable category”(see below) it would be desirableto havea list of (prefer-
ably easily-checkable) category-theoretic properties which cuts out exactly the
deﬁnable categories.
Apart from being additive, we would require having direct products a nd
direct limits. Since ultraproducts are certain direct limits of direct pr oducts
these conditions are enough to give a category an internal theory of purity since
we can deﬁne a pure monomorphism to be one, some ultraproduct of which is
split, and similarly we may deﬁne pure epimorphisms. So we might also add
the conditions that these have, respectively, cokernels and kern els. We should
also add some “smallness” condition since the properties mentioned s o far are
shared by all Grothendieck, indeed AB5, abelian categories and not every such
category is deﬁnable.
Theorem 3.6. A Grothendieck abelian category is deﬁnable iﬀ it is locally
ﬁnitely presented.
Proof.IfGis Grothendieck abelian and deﬁnable set A= fun(G). ThenGis
the deﬁnable subcategory,Ex( A,Ab) ofA-Mod consistingofthe exact functors.
We claim that the inclusion, i, ofGinA-Mod has a left adjoint, that is, that G
is a localisation of A-Mod.
First note that ipreserves kernels since if 0 →K→F→Gis exact with
F,G∈ Gthen, since those are exact, so is K. SinceGis deﬁnable, direct
products inGcoincide with those in A-Mod. Thus ipreserves limits. We also
have the solution set condition of the Adjoint Functor Theorem bec ause every
deﬁnable subcategory is covariantly ﬁnite and hence, given any M∈A-Mod
there is an arrow M→G∈Gthrough which every morphism from Mto an
object ofGfactors.
Thereforeihas a left adjoint Qwhich is left exact and hence Qis a lo-
calisation at a hereditary torsion theory. Since Gis deﬁnable the inclusion i
22

--- Page 23 ---

commutes with directed colimits so (see [42, 11.1.23]) this torsion theo ry is of ﬁ-
nite type and hence, see [42, 11.1.27], the localised category, G, is locally ﬁnitely
presented, as required. /square
Certainly any deﬁnable category Dis accessible: if we set κto be|R|+ℵ0,
ifDis a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- R, or the number of morphisms in a
skeleton of fun(D) then every object of Dis a structure for a functional lan-
guageofcardinality κandso(forinstancebythedownwardsLowenheim-Skolem
Theorem) is the direct limit of its subobjects (or pure, or even eleme ntary, sub-
objects) of cardinality ≤κ(orκ+ifκis not regular). Furthermore, each object
ofcardinality≤κisκ+-presentable,and there is just a setofthese up to isomor-
phism. ThusDisκ+-accessible (though, as already mentioned, not necessarily
ﬁnitely accessible). If we were content to work with inﬁnitary langua ges then
this would be enough (see [1, 5.35], [24, 9.1.7], also [25]).
For an intrinsic deﬁnition we suppose just that Dis additive with products
and direct limits. The proof of 3.12 below shows that ( D,Ab)→/producttext
is an abelian
category. If we also suppose that Dhas a lim−→-generating set of objects then
(D,Ab)→/producttext
is also skeletally small. Of course Dthen embeds naturally, via
D/mapsto→evD, intoEx/parenleftbig
(D,Ab)→/producttext
,Ab/parenrightbig
andweknow, using3.2, that thiswillbe an
equivalence iﬀDis deﬁnable. In some sense that is an intrinsic characterisation
but it is considerably less satisfactory than would be a list of condition s which
could be checked directly, because it is not clear how one might in gene ral check
that the embedding is an equivalence.
3.2 Extending from Pinj(D)toD
.
IfDis a deﬁnable category then any morphism F:D→CinDEFrestricts
to a functor on the full subcategory, Pinj( D), of pure-injective objects of Dto
C(indeed, see 3.7, to Pinj( C)). That restricted functor commutes with direct
products and with those direct limits of pure-injectives where the d irect limit
objecthappenstobeinPinj( D)(forshortwemaydescribethatsecondcondition
as “commuting with those direct limits in Pinj( D)”). In this section we consider
the converse. That is: suppose Pinj( D)→Ccommutes with direct products
and with those direct limits diagrams of objects in Pinj( D) whose direct limit
also is in Pinj(D); then does this extend to a morphism in DEFfromDto
C? We show that this is so. We also consider the question of whether na tural
transformationsbetween morphisms in DEFaredetermined by their restrictions
to the pure-injective objects. Again the answer is positive.
These issues already arise in the proof ([43, 12.10]) of the fact that , for
D∈DEF, the category fun( D) is equivalent to ( D,Ab)→/producttext
. Let us outline the
shape of that proof since we will be reconsidering parts of it here. T he ﬁrst part
consists of showing that (Pinj( D),Ab)/producttext
≃(Pinj(D),Ab)fpand then applying
the fact from[31] (see[43, 12.2])that (Pinj( D),Ab)fp≃(Fund(D))opin orderto
identify (Pinj(D),Ab)/producttext
with the opposite of the dual “large” functor category
Fund(D). Each of these latter two categories has a natural action on Pinj (D)
and, in the proof of [43, 12.10], it is shown that the identiﬁcation resp ects this.
Then we take a functor G∈(D,Ab)→/producttext
. The action of that functor on Pinj( D)
is then shown to coincide with the action on Pinj( D) of a functor of the form
Fφ/ψfor some pp-pair φ/ψ. The proof goes on to show that since these functors
23

--- Page 24 ---

agree on Pinj(D) they agree on D. We will generalise that last part here,
replacing the codomain Abby an arbitrary deﬁnable category and replacing
the natural isomorphism between the two functors (the restrict ions ofGandF
to Pinj(D)) by any natural transformation. And the ﬁrst part of that pro of,
which we will re-do rather more cleanly than in [43] (where category- theoretic
and element-based argumentation sit uncomfortably together), will allow us to
answer the ﬁrst question.
We will make use of the fact that every deﬁnable category Dhas anele-
mentary cogenerator , that isN∈Pinj(D) which is such that every object of
Dis a pure subobject of a direct product of copies of N(see [40, 9.36] or [42,
5.3.52]). We write /a\}bracketle{t−/a\}bracketri}htfor the deﬁnable subcategory generated by ( −). First we
recall the following.
Proposition 3.7. (see, e.g., [43, 13.1]) Suppose that I:C→Dis a morphism
inDEF. ThenIpreserves pure embeddings and pure-injectivity. If D′⊆Dis
a deﬁnable subcategory of DthenI−1D′={C∈C:IC∈D′}is a deﬁnable
subcategory ofC.
Proposition 3.8. IfI:D→Cis a morphism in DEFthen every object of
/a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}htis a pure subobject of an object of the form ID. IfNis an elementary
cogenerator forDthenINis an elementary cogenerator for /a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}ht.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement will follow from the second by 3.7 and since I
commutes with direct products. Since Nis an elementary cogenerator it is
clear that/a\}bracketle{tIN/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}htand hence the support of INin the Ziegler spectrum
ofCis Zg(/a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}ht). Therefore every N1∈Zg(/a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}ht) is a direct summand of an
ultrapower of (a power of) IN. Since every ultrapower of Nis pure in a direct
power ofN, so the same is true of IN,N1is, therefore, a direct summand of a
power ofIN. Then the fact that every point of Zg( /a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}ht) is a direct summand
of a power of INis enough (see [42, 5.3.50]) to imply that INis an elementary
cogenerator of/a\}bracketle{tID/a\}bracketri}ht./square
Theorem 3.9. Suppose that F,G:D⇒Care functors in DEFand thatτ′:F↾
Pinj(D)→G↾Pinj(D)is a natural transformation between their restrictions
to the pure-injectives of D. Then there is a, unique, natural transformation
τ:F→Gwhich restricts to τ′. Ifτ′is a natural isomorphism then so is τ.
Proof. We use an argument from the proof of [43, 12.10]. Let M∈Dand
choose a pure embedding Mi− →N∈Pinj(D) into a pure-injective. Choose a set
Iand an ultraﬁlter FonIsuch that both MI/FandNI/F(and hence also
their images under FandG) are pure-injective (see, e.g., [42, [4.2.19] or [43,
21.3]). Consider the diagram shown, where ∆ (−)is the diagonal map into the
ultraproduct.

GM; that is, the right-hand side is a pullback. So, working round the com mu-
tative squares, we obtain a unique map, which we denote τM, fromFMtoGM
making the whole diagram commute. (Note that this is independent of choice
ofNsince, given another choice of initial embedding i′:M→N′, we can use
(i,i′) :M→N⊕N′, to deﬁne “ τM” which, one may check, restricts to the
otherwise-constructed τMs.
Arguing similarly one checks that the τMcohere to form a natural transfor-
mation from FtoG. The last statement follows easily. /square
It is clear from the proof that it is suﬃcient that the natural trans formation

elementary cogenerator would be enough.
Proposition 3.10. Suppose thatC,Dare additive categories with products and
coproducts and suppose that Cis abelian. Let (D,C)/producttext
denote the category of
those functors from DtoCwhich commute with direct products. Suppose that
G∈(D,C)is generated. Then G∈(D,C)/producttext
iﬀG∈(D,C)fp, the category of
ﬁnitely presented functors from DtoC.
Proof.We recall that a functor GfromDtoCisﬁnitely generated if it is
a quotient of a (ﬁnite direct sum of) representable functor(s) an dGisﬁnitely
presented ifthekernelofsuchapresentationisitselfﬁnitelygenerated. Bew are
that, becauseDhas a proper class of objects, not every functor on it will be
generated , that is, determined by its action on a set of objects; that is, not
every functor has a presentation (let alone a ﬁnite one).
For one direction, suppose that G∈(D,C)fp, so there is a morphism f:
N→N′inDsuch that ( N′,−)(f,−)−−−→(N,−)→G→0 is exact. Since both
(N′,−) and (N,−) commute with products (by deﬁnition of direct product)
and since, as an additive functor category, direct products in D,C) are exact,
it follows that Gcommutes with products. Thus ( D,C)fpis a subcategory of
(D,C)/producttext
.
For the converse, suppose that G∈(D,C) commutes with direct products,
meaning that for any indexed set ( Ni)i∈Iof objects ofDthe canonical map

Corollary 3.11. Suppose thatC,Dare deﬁnable categories with Cabelian.
Then(Pinj(D),C)/producttext
= (Pinj(D),C)fp.
Proof.By 3.10 it must be shown that every functor Gwhich commutes with
products is generated. First we note, as a general point, that giv enA,Bin an
additive category with coproducts, every morphism from a coprod uctA(I)of
copies ofAtoBfactors through the canonical morphism c:A(A,B)→Bwhere
c= (h)h∈(A,B). For, iff:A(I)→Bisf= (fi)iwithfi:A(i)→Bthen, for
eachi∈I, choose an isomorphism A(i)→A(the copy appearing in “ A(A,B)”,
which we assume to be replicated in a speciﬁed way at each h∈(A,B)) and
deﬁneh(i) to be the composition shown.

holds by deﬁnition of h(i), as required.
Now letNbe an elementary cogenerator for Dand letG∈(Pinj(D),C)/producttext
.
So, ifN′∈Pinj(D) then there is a split exact sequence of the form 0 →N′→
NI→N′′→0 and hence a split exact sequence 0 →(N′′,−)→(NI,−)→
(N′,−)→0 in (Pinj(D),C). In particular any morphism d′: (N′,−)→Glifts
to somed: (NI,−)→G. Under the identiﬁcation (( NI,−),G)≃G(NI)≃
(GN)I,dcorresponds to some d= (di)i∈Iwithdi∈GN≃((N,−),G). Thus
we have an induced map i/mapsto→di:I→GNand hence an induced χd:NGN→
NI. That, in turn, induces ( χd,−) : (NI,−)→(NGN,−) and so (χd,G) :
((NGN,−),G)→((NI,−),G) which takes c1∈((NGN,−),G) todwherec1
corresponds to c∈((N,−)(GN),G) (notation as above) viathe isomorphism
((N,−)(GN),G)≃((N,−),G)GN≃((NGN,−),G) (the latter being that G
commutes with products). In particular d, and hence d′, factors through c1and
we deduce that c1: (NGN,−)→Gis an epimorphism. /square
Note that an abelian deﬁnable category is Grothendieck (hence, 3.6 , locally
ﬁnitely presented): it is complete and well-powered, so it is suﬃcient t o check
26

--- Page 27 ---

that it has exact direct limits but, being a subcategory of a Grothen dieck (func-
tor) category and being closed in that category under direct limits, this follows.
Lemma 3.12. Suppose thatDis a deﬁnable category and that Cis an abelian
deﬁnable category. Then (D,C)→/producttext
, that is, DEF(D,C)is a skeletally small
abelian category.
Proof.Itis easilycheckedthat thiscategory(orthe equivalent, by1.1, ca tegory
Ex(fun(C),fun(D)) is skeletally small (see the proof of 3.13 below) and additive.
Ifτ:F→Gis an arrow in (D,C)→/producttext
then we can deﬁne ker( τ) to be the
functor taking D∈Dto ker(τD) (which exists since Cis abelian) and having
action on arrows given in the obvious way (see the diagram).

Since inCboth direct limits and direct products are exact, this functor ker( τ)
also commutes with these (as in the proof below) and the inclusion of it into
Fis, indeed, the kernel of τ. Dually we obtain coker( τ) also in (D,C)→/producttext
. In
a similar way we can see that every monomorphism in ( D,C)→/producttext
has all its
components monomorphisms and is a cokernel, and dually for epimorp hisms.
/square
Lemma 3.13. Suppose thatDis a deﬁnable category and that Cis an abelian
deﬁnable category. Then (Pinj(D),C)→/producttext
is a skeletally small abelian category.
Proof.To see that this functor category is abelian we use that (Pinj( D),C)→/producttext
is a full subcategory of the (large) functor category (Pinj( D),C) in which both/producttextand lim−→are exact, from which it follows easily (see the proof above) that
(Pinj(D),C)→/producttext
is abelian. For example, if τ:F→Gis a morphism in
(Pinj(D),C)→/producttext
then we have, in (Pinj( D),C), the exact sequence σ: 0→
ker(τ)→Fτ− →G→coker(τ)→0. So then, if D= lim−→λDλis a direct limit
in Pinj(D), then we have the exact sequences σ(Dλ) forming a directed system
of exact sequences in Cwith exact direct limit. But also σ(D) is exact and so,
comparing these sequences, we deduce that lim−→λ(ker(τ)·(Dλ)) = ker(τ)·D.
To show that the category is skeletally small we use that the proof f or the
caseC=Abis done within the proof of [43, 12.10]. That proof works in the
more general case but carryingthat through would require settin g up quite a bit
of the background material (in particular that relating to the cate gory Fund(D)
which makes an appearance). An easier alternative is to note that t he case
C=Abis enough since we may regard objects of Cas modules over some small
preadditive category R, hence as multi-sorted structures with a sort for each
objectPofR. Then the composition of a functor preserving products and
directed colimits to Cwith evalution ( C/mapsto→((P,−),C)) at a particular sort is a
functor (preserving products and directed colimits). There is jus t a set of sorts
and a set of morphisms between them so, putting together the dat a from the
separate sorts, and since we know that (Pinj( D),Ab)→/producttext
is a set, we deduce
that (Pinj(D),C)→/producttext
is a set. /square
27

--- Page 28 ---

We will now specialise to the case C=Ab; we could continue with the
general case but we wish to quote, in the proof of 3.17, a result whic h is proved
in the caseC=Ab). In this case also, the proof of the quoted result would
generalise easily enough but, rather than do that, we will say how to obtain the
general case from what we do.
Let us setB= (Pinj(D),Ab)→/producttext
and also suppose that Ais a small abelian
category such that D= Ex(A,Ab). Certainly the action of each object of A
on Pinj(D) commutes with direct products and those direct limits in Pinj( D),
so we have a functor from AtoB.
Lemma 3.14. With notation as above, the functor from AtoBis a faithful,
full and exact embedding.
Proof.IftwoobjectsofAagreeonPinj(D) then, since everyobjectof Dis pure
in a pure-injective object, they agree on all of D; ditto, by 3.9, for morphisms
between such. A sequence of morphisms in Ais exact iﬀ it is exact at each
object ofDiﬀ it is exact on each object of Pinj( D), in other words, iﬀ its image
inBis exact; the fact that a sequence of functors/objects of Awhich is is exact
on Pinj(D) is exact onDfollows again because every object of Dis pure in an
object of Pinj(D).
By 3.9 the embedding of AintoBis full.
Note, for later use, that this proof works with any deﬁnable abelian category
Cin place of Ab./square
We are going to prove that the embedding of AintoBis an equivalence. In
model-theoreticterms,regardingobjectsofPinj( D)asfunctorsonAisregarding
them asA-structures(structuresforthe languageof A-modules) but, aswe have
just seen, and this is said in more detail below, they are also B-structures. So
our question about extending functors from Pinj( D) toDis equivalent to asking
whether everyA-structure in the deﬁnable category Dis also aB-structure.
embpinj
Lemma3.15. Suppose thatDis a deﬁnable category. Let B= (Pinj(D),Ab)→/producttext
- a skeletally small abelian category. Then there is a natura l full embedding of
Pinj(D)into the deﬁnable category D= Ex(B,Ab). Each object N∈Pinj(D)
is pure-injective as a B-structure.
Proof.The embedding is that which takes N∈Pinj(D) to the functor, ev N,
evaluation-at- N. That it is full can be argued as follows. As above, we suppose
thatD= Ex(A,Ab) for some small abelian category Aand we have the restric-
tion of actions of objects of AfromDto Pinj(A), giving the embedding from
3.14 ofAintoB. Then any natural transformation, τ: evN→evN′, between
evaluation-on-Bfunctors (i.e. objects of Pinj( D) regarded asB-structures) re-
stricts to one between evaluation-on- Afunctors (i.e.A-structures) and that is
just a morphism from NtoN′as objects ofD.
Now we show pure-injectivity as B-structures. Let us write NBinstead of
evNto emphasise the view of these as structures. Then, given N∈Pinj(D),
there is some index set Iand ultraﬁlterFonIsuch that the ultrapower NI
B/F
is pure-injective as a B-structure. It is, in particular, pure-injective as an A-
structure. Consider the diagonal map but regarded as a (pure) e mbedding of
A-structures: ( NB)A→(NI
B/F)A. Theﬁrstobjectcanbeidentiﬁedwith Nand
hencethismapissplit. Thereforethe imageofthismapregardedinth ecategory
ofB-structures is split. But, since the action of the objects of Bcommute with
28

--- Page 29 ---

ultraproducts of objects of Pinj( D) (since ultraproducts are certain direct limits
of products), we have NI
B/F= (NI/F)Band so the diagonal embedding of NB
intoNI
B/Fis split. Thus NBis pure-injective. /square
Note thatDis naturally a subcategory of DviaA→B.
Dbar
Corollary 3.16. With notation as above, Pinj(D) = Pinj(D)and soDis the
deﬁnable subcategory of Mod-Bgenerated by Pinj(D).
Proof.IfNBis pure-injective as a B-structure then certainly it is pure-injective
as anA-structure, and we have just shown the converse. /square
Corollary 3.17. For any deﬁnable category we have D=D.
Proof.By [31, p. 462] (see [43, 12.2]), the category A= fun(D) is determined
by Pinj(D) (speciﬁcally fun( D) = ((((Pinj(D),Ab)fp)op)fp)op) and so, retaining
the notation from above, A=Band henceD=D./square
Theorem 3.18. LetAbe a skeletally small abelian category and let D=
Ex(A,Ab)be the corresponding deﬁnable category. Then A= (Pinj(D),Ab)→/producttext
.
In particular every functor on Pinj(D)which commutes with direct products and
those direct limits which are in Pinj(D)extends to a unique functor in DEFfrom
DtoAb.
We remark that we do mean “unique” (as opposed to unique to natur al
equivalence), the point being that every object of Dis a (pure) subobject of a
pure-injective object.
In order to return to the general case, we set A′= (D,C)→/producttext
andB′=
(Pinj(D),C)→/producttext
. As remarked in the proof of 3.14, we have a full, faithful and
exact embedding A′→B′. If this were not an equivalence then the correspond-
ing deﬁnable categories would not be equivalent - that is, there would be an
exact functor D′fromA′toAbwhich does not extend to an exact functor from
B′toAb. That would be a C-valued model which distinguishes between A′and
B′. But, by the analogue, 4.8 below, of Deligne’s theorem, there would t hen
be anAb-valued model which distinguishes AandB(in the above notation) -
contradicting 3.18.
Example 3.19.This example compares two very closely related deﬁnable cat-
egories from the point of view of this section. Take Dto be the category of
modules over the localisation Z(p)ofZ. Then every pure-injective Z(p)-module
is also a pure-injective Z(p)-module and the converse is almost true, the diﬀer-
ence being that although Qis a pure-injective Z(p)-module the corresponding
(indecomposable, torsionfree injective) Z(p)-module is the direct sum of con-
tinuum many copies of Q. We have the inclusion of Mod- Z(p)into Mod- Z(p)
but not as a deﬁnable subcategory since the former is not closed un der pure
submodules. If r∈Z(p)\Z(p)and we let Gbe the functor from Mod- Z(p)to
Ab, and hence from Pinj(Mod- Z(p)toAb, which is multiplication by rthen
this does not extend to a functor on Mod- Z(p).

3.3Ex(A,D)is deﬁnable when Dis Grothendieck
We know that if A ∈ABEXthen Ex(A,Ab) is a deﬁnable category. We
show that, more generally, if Dis a deﬁnable category and is abelian, hence
Grothendieck, hence locally ﬁnitely presented, then Ex( A,D) is again deﬁnable.
First we consider the case that Ais Ab(R) and thatDis Mod-Sfor some
skeletally small preadditive categories RandS.
Lemma 3.20. IfR,S∈PREADD then(R,Mod-S)≃R-Mod-Sthe category
of(R,S)-bimodules.
Proof.An additive functor R→Mod-Sis anS-moduleMStogether with a
leftR-module action in which each multiplication by r∈R(meaningris a
morphism ofR) is a homomorphism in Mod- S, that is, such that the R- and
S-actions commute. A natural transformation from one such to th e other is
given by anS-module homomorphism MS→NSwhich commutes with each
r-action, that is, a homomorphism of bimodules. /square
exchains
Example 3.21.TakeSto be the preadditive S-category freely generated by the
quiver···→•n−1→•n→•n+1→...whereSis a ring, so Mod- Sis the
category of chains of S-modules (with the arrows going right to left) (of which,
note both the category of chain complexes and the category of ex act chain
complexes are deﬁnable subcategories). Let Rbe the preadditive S-category
generated by∗→∗′. Then an (R,S)-bimodule, a functor from Rto Mod-S, is
given by two chains of S-modules and a morphism between them (meaning that
all the squares commute). So R-Mod-Sis the category of morphisms between
chains ofS-modules, alternatively of representations of the quiver A2=•→•
in the category of complexes of S-modules.
Since an additive functor R →Mod-Sis equivalent to an exact functor
Ab(R)→Mod-S(2.1) we obtain the next corollary.
Corollary 3.22. IfR,S∈PREADD thenEx(Ab(R),Mod-S)≃R-Mod-S=
(R⊗Sop)-Mod≃Ex(Ab(R⊗Sop),Ab).
From this special case we will extend to the general one. We will take the
view of (R,S)-bimodules from the proof of the lemma above: that they are
Obj(R)-indexed collections of objects of Mod- Slinked by the arrows of R. So,
in general, an (R,S)-bimodule is, if we forgetthe R-module structure, not an S-
module but a collection of S-modules. We will refer to these as the component
S-modulesofthebimoduleand,ofcourse,wemaymakerestrictionso ntheseand
hence restrictionson the bimodule. In particular, if Dis a deﬁnable subcategory
of Mod-S, deﬁned by certain axioms (which specify that certain pp-pairs sho uld
be closed) then it makes sense to require that each component of a n (R,S)-
bimodule lie inD. Clearly this is a set of conditions in the language of ( R,S)-
bimodules specifying closure of certain pp-pairs and hence gives a de ﬁnable
subcategoryof (R,S)-Mod. We present an example before stating this formally.
Example 3.23.In the example above, the category of chain complexes of S-
modules is deﬁnable; let us be more explicit about this. The language fo rS-
modules has a sort, snsay, for each integer nand, for each n, a constant symbol
0nfor the 0 in sort n, a 2-ary function symbol + nfor addition in that sort and,
for eachs∈Sa 1-ary function symbol, let us write it as fs,nfor multiplication
30

--- Page 31 ---

bysin that sort (though, in practice we would just write it as “ s” in formulas).
We also have in the language a function symbol, fdnsay, for the given arrow, dn
say, from•nto•n+1; because we chose to look at right S-modules, that is Sop-
modules, the symbol dnwill be for a function going from sort sn+1to sortsn.
The condition on a right S-module that the composition d2be zero is equivalent
to closure of the pp-pair ( ∃yn+1(xn−1=fdnfdn−1yn+1))/(xn−1= 0) or, writing
it aswewouldwriteformulasformodules, ( ∃yn+1(xn=yn+1dndn−1))/(xn−1=
0) (the subscripts to the variables indicate their sort, though in th ese formulas
they are redundant since they are determined by the sorting of th e function
symbols). Similarly, exactness of chain complexes can be axiomatised by adding
to these pairs the collection of pp-pairs of the form ( xndn−1= 0)/(∃xn+1(xn=
xn+1dn)).
The language for ( R,S)-bimodules will have its sorts indexed by Obj( R)×
Obj(S); denote these as s∗n,s∗′n(n∈Z). So if we take our set of pp-pairs to
havea “∗-copy”and a “∗′-copy”ofeach ofthe abovepp-pairsthen these will cut
out the subcategories of A2-representations in chain complexes (respectively, in
exact complexes) of S-modules.
(Ofcourseoneneed notuse thesameset of S-module axiomsoneachcompo-
nentS-module so one can see further ways of specifying deﬁnable subcat egories
of (R,S)-Mod.)
Proposition 3.24. SupposeR∈PREADD andDis an abelian deﬁnable cate-
gory. Then Ex(Ab(R),D)≃Ex(B,Ab)for someB∈ABEX.
Proof.Suppose thatDis a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- S. Then, as argued
above,anadditivefunctorfrom RtoDisjust an(R,S)-bimodule whichbelongs
to a certain deﬁnable subcategory of the functor category ( R⊗Sop)-Mod. That
is, (R,D) isadeﬁnable subcategoryof( R,S)-Mod, henceis adeﬁnablecategory
and so Ex(Ab(R),D)≃(R,D)≃Ex(B,Ab) for someB∈ABEX./square
The ﬁnal step is to replace Ab( R) by a generalA∈ABEXbut that, asnoted
in 2.18, has the form Ab( R)/Tfor someR∈PREADD andT ∈Ser(Ab(R)).
Then the quotient functor Ab( R)→Ab(R)/T=Ainduces an embedding of
Ex(A,D) as a subcategory of Ex(Ab( R),D), namely as the full subcategory on
thosefunctorswhichannihilatethe Serresubcategory T. We havejust seenthan
Ex(Ab(R),D) is deﬁnable and it is easy to see that the condition of annihilating
Tis a deﬁnable one: for each object of (a generating set of) Tchoose a pp-pair
which deﬁnes it (we are using, as we did near the beginning of Section 2 .3, the
description of these exact functors as pp-pairs). Thus we have a n embedding of
Ex(A,D) as a deﬁnable subcategory of Ex(Ab( R),D) and so Ex(A,D) is indeed
deﬁnable.
Theorem 3.25. Suppose thatAis a skeletally small abelian category and that D
is a deﬁnable category which is abelian. Then Ex(A,D)is a deﬁnable category,
in particular is equivalent to Ex(B,Ab)for some small abelian category B.
In the topos-analogy view of the next section, one would say that if E=
Ex(A,Ab)isadeﬁnablecategoryand Disanabelian=locallyﬁnitelypresented
Grothendieck deﬁnable category then Ex( A,D) is the category of D-models of
the regular theory with (the additive version of) classifying pretop osA, as
opposed to the category EofAb-models.

4 Locally coherent additive categories
Recall that an object Aof an additive category Aisﬁnitely presented if the
representable functor ( A,−) :A→Abcommutes with direct limits. Set Afp
to be the full subcategory of ﬁnitely presented objects of A. We say that Ais
coherent ifit isﬁnitelypresentedandeachofitsﬁnitely generatedsubobject sis
ﬁnitely presented. An abelian category Gwith direct limits is locally coherent
iﬀ it has a generating set consisting of coherent objects. Such a ca tegory is, in
particular, ﬁnitely accessible, hence ([12, 2.4]) Grothendieck. It is e asy to check
that in such a category ﬁnitely presented = coherent. The catego ry Mod-Ris
locally coherent iﬀ Risright coherent .
The connection between ABEXandCOHgoes back to Gabriel [17, 11.4
Thm. 1] (for locally noetherian categories) and Roos [48, 2.2] (in gen eral), also
see [37].
Theorem 4.1. IfAis a skeletally small abelian category then Lex(Aop,Ab)≃
Flat-A≃Ind(A)is a locally coherent Grothendieck category GwithGfp≃A.
IfGis a locally coherent Grothendieck category then Gfpis abelian andG≃
Lex((Gfp)op,Ab).
The Ind-completion, Ind( A), ofAis the free extension of Ato a category
withdirectlimits(theobjectscanbedeﬁnedtobeequivalenceclasse sofdirected
diagrams inA, see, e.g., [3, Exp. 1, §8], [26,§VI.1], [28, Chpt. 6]). To see why
Flat-A≃Ind(A) recall that the ﬂat right A-modules are the direct limits of
(ﬁnitely presented) projective A-modules and those are the images of objects of
Aunder the Yoneda embedding.
The morphisms of COHare adjoint pairs of functors where the left adjoint
is exact and preserves coherence of objects. Precisely, a morph ismf:G→H
is given by a morphism f∗:H→Gand a morphism f∗:G→Hsuch that
(f∗,f∗) is an adjoint pair with the left adjoint f∗being (left) exact and with
f∗Hfp⊆Gfp. We referto these as coherent morphisms anda typicalnotation
isf:G→H, which expands to G
f∗/d53/d53Hf∗
/d118/d118. This is an additive analogue of the
deﬁnition of a geometric morphism, e.g. [27, A4.1.1], with the added ﬁnit eness
condition that f∗preserve coherent objects. Such pairs of functors have alread y
been considered by Krause, see [30, SS9-11]; in particular, [30, 6.7], the functor
f∗also preserves direct limits (as well as absolutely pure and injective o bjects -
that is, the corresponding deﬁnable categories and their pure-inj ective objects,
the absolutely pure objects being the exact functors, see, e.g., [4 3,§11]).
The 2-arrows of COHare the natural transformations. More precisely, if
f,g:G→Hare morphisms, then a 2-arrow from f= (f∗,f∗) tog= (g∗,g∗)
is a natural transformation τ∗:f∗→g∗equivalently, see below, a natural
transformation τ∗:g∗→f∗.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose that f= (f∗,f∗)andg= (g∗,g∗)are two adjoint pairs
of functors from GtoH. Then there is a natural bijection between natural
transformations τ∗:f∗→g∗and natural transformations τ∗:g∗→f∗. This
bijection commutes with composition of natural transforma tions as well as with
horizontal and vertical composition of natural transforma tion with functors.

The correspondence between ABEXandCOHappears in [45] but without
details (there the focus is on the anti-equivalence between ABEXandDEF; the
suggestion of considering the associated locally coherent categor ies came from
the referee of that paper). Here we give the some details (since I a m not aware
of any reference for them).
Theorem 4.3. There is a natural anti-equivalence of 2-categories betwee nCOH
andABEX, as described above.
We have already seen, in 4.1, the correspondence on objects. On m orphisms,
the anti-equivalence between ABEXandCOHis as follows.
Proposition 4.4. ([30, 10.1]) To each arrow f0∈Ex(A,B)there corresponds
the coherent morphism f= (f∗,f∗) :H= Ind(B)→Ind(A) =Gwhich has
f∗:H= Lex(Bop,Ab)→Lex(Aop,Ab) =Gjust precomposition with fop
0
and hasf∗= Ind(f0)(the Ind-construction is deﬁned in an obvious way on
functors).
In the other direction we take an arrow (f∗,f∗) :H→Gtof∗↾Gfp.
Proof. The second statement is immediate since if f∗is exact then so is its
restriction. For the ﬁrst statement, the only part that takes so me checking is
thatfis a coherent morphism.
First, we show that Ind( f0) is exact. Given an exact sequence 0 →G′→
G→G′′→0 inGwriteGas a direct limit of ﬁnitely presented objects,
G= lim−→Gλ, letG′
λbe the pullback of Gλ→GandG′→G, writeG′
λas a
direct limit of ﬁnitely generated (hence ﬁnitely presented) subobje ctsG′
λµand
setG′′
λµ= coker(G′
λ,µ→Gλ) and note the induced canonical map G′′
λµ→G′′
λ.
All these exact sequences ﬁt together into a directed system in Gfp, the colimit
of which is the original exact sequence. Since f0is exact, the component exact
sequences 0→G′
λµ→Gλ→G′′
λµ→0 are taken by it to exact sequences in
H. These exact sequences form a directed system in Hand so the direct limit
is exact and, by deﬁnition of f∗as Ind(f0), that direct limit is 0 →f∗G′→
f∗G→f∗G′′→0, sof∗is exact. Of course, by deﬁnition f∗takesGfptoGfp.
We must show that Ind( f0) is left adjoint to f∗, so takeH∈HandG∈G.
WriteGas a direct limit, G= lim−→λGλ, of ﬁnitely presented objects in Gwhere
we haveGλ= (−,Aλ) for some directed system {Aλ}λof objects ofA. Then:

Example 4.5.Leti0betheinclusionofthecategory,reg- k/tildewiderA1, ofﬁnite-dimensional
regular modules over the Kronecker algebra k/tildewiderA1(or over any tame heredi-
tary ﬁnite-dimensional algebra)into the categorymod- k/tildewiderA1of ﬁnite-dimensional
modules. This is exact, so induces a coherent morphism as above, wit h the left
adjoint being the inclusion of all regular modules (i.e. direct limits of ﬁnit e-
dimensional regular modules) and the right adjoint taking an arbitra ryk/tildewiderA1-
moduleMto the module which, in the notation and terminology of [47, p. 326]
(also see [46]) isT(M)/I(M) whereT(M), the torsion submodule of M, is the
sum of all regular and preinjective submodules of M, modulo the sum, I(M) of
all preinjective submodules of Mwhich, since the ring is tame hereditary, will
be a direct summand ([47, 3.7]).
We explore this example a bit further. The category reg- k/tildewiderA1is a direct
sum of uniserial abelian categories indexed by P1(k), that indexed by an irre-
ducible monic polynomial f∈k[T] being equivalent to the category of ﬁnitely
generated torsion modules over k[T](f). The Ind-completion of this category
is, by [32, 2.1(iii)], the full subcategory, Reg- k/tildewiderA1, on thosek/tildewiderA1-modules every
ﬁnite-dimensional submodule of which is regular, and is equivalent to t he direct
product of the categories of torsion modules over the various loca lisations of
k[T].
The functor ( i0)∗:M/mapsto→T(M)/I(M) takes the generic module G, since it
is a direct limit of preprojective modules and since, by [30, 6.7], ( i0)∗commutes
with direct limits, to 0. Also, given any preinjective module Ithere is, by [46,
§§6,7], an exact sequence 0 →V′→V→I→0 withV′a direct sum of copies
ofGandVa direct sum of copies of Gand Pr¨ ufer modules. The image under
(i0)∗of this exact sequence has, therefore, just the one possibly non -zero term
(i0)∗V; but this is 0 only if the sequence is split - which need not be the case -
and so (i0)∗is not exact.
Thedeﬁnable categorycorrespondingto k/tildewiderA1-mod is, by1.3, Proj- k/tildewiderA1. That
corresponding to reg- k/tildewiderA1is Ex(reg-k/tildewiderA1,Ab) which, by the decomposition of
reg-k/tildewiderA1, is equivalent to the P1(k)-indexed product of categories of the form
Ex(tors-k[T](f),Ab) which (cf. a similar computation in [44]) may be computed
to be equivalent to the category of reduced ﬂat k[T](f)-modules. Putting these
together, we deduce that Ex(reg- k/tildewiderA1,Ab) may be taken to be the category
of “reduced torsionfree” k/tildewiderA1-modules. The elementary dual of this category
consistsofthe direct sums ofPr¨ ufer(“torsionmodulo divisible”, s ee[47, p. 326])
k/tildewiderA1-modules.
Here is the action of duality on COH: ifG= Lex((Gfp)op,Ab) is a locally
34

--- Page 35 ---

coherent Grothendieck category then the duality induced on COHwill take it
to Lex(Gfp,Ab) which is the conjugate category in the sense of Roos ([48,
p. 204]) and which is denoted /tildewideG. The action on morphisms is as follows: if
(f∗,f∗) :H→Gis the coherent morphism induced by f0∈Ex(A,B) then its
“conjugate” is the coherent morphism induced by fop
0∈Ex(Aop,Bop), namely
(/tildewidef∗,/tildewidef∗) :/tildewideH→/tildewideGwith/tildewidef∗being precomposition with f0and/tildewidef∗= Ind(fop
0).
This follows directly from the deﬁnition of the involution on ABEXand the
description of the equivalence in 4.3.
One might note any locally coherent Grothendieck category Galso is an
object of DEF, however, its elementary dual Gd(Section 3) need not (though in
some cases will) coincide with its conjugate: for example, if Ris right coherent
but not left coherent then the conjugate category of Mod- R(which is described
in [48]) cannot be its elementary dual R-Mod since the latter is not locally
coherent.
IfGis a locally coherent Grothendieck category then a full subcategor yG′
is aGiraud subcategory if it isreﬂective , that is, the inclusion i:G′→G
has a left adjoint and that left adjoint is (left) exact. These are ex actly the
subcategories of Gof the formGτ, obtained by localising Gat a hereditary
torsion theory τand then composing the localisation functor Qτ:G→Gτwith
its right adjoint (which embeds the localised category back into G). This is the
additive analogue of sheaﬁﬁcation in the topos/categories of shea ves context.
Proposition 4.6. Letτbe a hereditary torsion theory on the locally coherent
Grothendieck category G. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
(i)Gτ
i/d54/d54GQτ/d116/d116is a coherent morphism from GτtoG;
(ii) the localisation functor Qτtakes ﬁnitely presented objects of Gto ﬁnitely
presented objects of Gτ;
(iii)τis of ﬁnite type (equivalently, since Gis locally coherent, an elementary
torsion theory in the sense of [38], see [42, §11.1.3])
Proof.The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is just the deﬁnitions. That (iii) implies
these is part of [42, 11.1.26]. We could ﬁnish by appealing to [30, 6.7] and ,
e.g., [42, 11.1.12] but a direct proof is straightforward, as follows. S uppose that
τis not of ﬁnite type. Then there is G∈GfpandG′≤Gwhich isτ-dense
(i.e.G/G′is torsion) but which has no ﬁnitely generated τ-dense subobject (we
do assume some acquaintance with torsion theory here - see [49], th ough what
is in [42, Chpt. 11] should suﬃce). So G′=/summationtext
λclG′
τGλ- the directed sum of
theτ-closures in G′of its ﬁnitely generated subobjects - and for each λwe have
clG′
τGλ<G′.
SinceGis locally coherent each Gλis ﬁnitely presented so, by hypothesis,
QτGλis a ﬁnitely presented object of Gτ. SinceQτis a left adjoint it com-
mutes with directed colimits so we have QτG=QτG′=Qτlim−→λclG′
τ(Gλ) =
lim−→λQτclG′
τ(Gλ) = lim−→λQτclG
τ(Gλ) (sinceG′isτ-dense inG) = lim−→λQτGλ. If
QτGwere ﬁnitely presented then there would be λsuch thatQτGλ=QτGand
hence such that Gλisτ-dense inGso, in particular, Gλwould beτ-dense in
G′- a contradiction. /square

Example 4.7.TakeAto be the categoryof ﬁnite abelian groups and Bto be the
category of ﬁnitely generated abelian groups, so Ind( i), whereiis the inclusion
ofAinB, is the inclusion of the category, Tors- Z, of torsion abelian groups in
Mod-Z, with right adjoint the torsion functor τ. This give a coherent morphism
from Mod- Zto Tors-Z: Mod-Z
τ/d50/d50Tors-ZInd(i)/d114/d114. Note that in this example it
is the case that τpreserves ﬁnitely presented objects; this is far from being
the case for a general coherent morphism (consider, for instanc e the example
Mod-Q
i/d50/d50Mod-ZQτ=−⊗Q/d113/d113of 4.6).
4.1 The additive version of the classifying topos
In this section we draw out explicitly the analogies between what we ha ve here
and the situation seen in topos theory. Recall ([3], [27], [33]) that if Cis a
(skeletally) small category then a contravariant functor from Cto the category,
Set, of sets is referred to as a presheaf onC. In the classical case - that
of a presheaf on a topological space - the category Cis the collection of open
subsets of the space, ordered by inclusion and thereby conceived of as a poset-
type category (indeed a locale). The category, ( Cop,Set), of such functors is
the non-additive correspondent to the category, Mod- R= (Rop,Ab), of right
modules over a (skeletally) small preadditive category R.
A Grothendieck topology on Cis a notion of “covering” (generalising the
notion of open cover in topology); Ctogether with a Grothendieck topology is
termed a site. The additive analogue is a hereditary torsion theory o n Mod-R
(presented as a system of dense subobjects of the generating p rojectives (−,P)
forP∈R). A sheaf for a site is a presheaf which satisﬁes the sheaf condition s
(existence and uniqueness of patchings) for that site. There is a s heaﬁﬁcation
functor on the category of presheaves and the resulting catego ry of sheaves has
an embedding, right adjoint to sheaﬁﬁcation, as a full subcategor y of the cate-
gory of presheaves. The additive analogue of a sheaf is a module whic h is tor-
sionfree and divisible with respect to the torsion theory. There is a lo calisation
(=sheaﬁﬁcation) functor on the category of modules and the res ulting quotient
category has an embedding, right adjoint to localisation, as a full su bcategory
of the category of modules.
The analogy is wide, extends right down to technical details, and has been
known for a long time. An algebraist need only skim through the releva nt
sections of [6] and a category-theorist through [49] to see the pa rallels. This
paper, motivated by the model theory of additive structures, is, in part, drawing
out the analogy further and I hope that it is a useful thing to do and that it will
give further insight and results. So far as I am aware there is no way of directly
deducing the additive version of results from the Set-version. Of c ourse, one
can say that the former is an enriched version of the latter but it is n ot clear
to me that allows one to avoid having to write down the details to obtain the
additive version.
A Grothendieck topos is the category of sheaves on a site; the add itive
analogue is the notion of a Grothendieck abelian category. There is a notion
of coherent topos - this can be deﬁned as a topos which can be obta ined from
36

--- Page 37 ---

a presheaf category by sheaﬁﬁcation at a ﬁnite-type site (see [33 ,§IX.11]). A
ﬁnite-type site is one where the underlying category Chas ﬁnite limits and the
topology has a basis of ﬁnite covering families. Analogously a locally coh erent
Grothendieck categoryis one which can be obtained by a ﬁnite-type localisation
of a locally coherent module category, and a module category is locally coherent
iﬀ it is (Morita) equivalent to one of the form Mod- RwhereRhas ﬁnite weak
limits. The last statement is almost in [12] and the former statement a lmost in
[42,§§11.1.3,11.1.4]. Thus COHis the additive analogue of the 2-category of
coherent toposes.
As forABEX, there is a general notion of coherent object: it is an object
Csuch that whenever one has a pullback
P /d47/d47
/d15/d15B
/d15/d15
B′ /d47/d47C
whereB,B′are ﬁnitely generated ( Bisﬁnitely generated if the representable
functor (B,−) commutes with directed colimits of monomorphisms) then Palso
is ﬁnitely generated. If Eis a locally coherent topos then the full subcategory of
coherent objects forms what is termed a pretopos [27, §A1.4]; such a skeletally
small, generating, subcategory is the analogue of GfpwhenG∈COH. Thus the
pretoposeswhichsoarisearethe analoguesofskeletallysmallabelia ncategories.
Theanalogueof DEFarisesthroughthelinkbetweentoposesandmathemat-
ical logic. There is a very general notion of “geometric theory” (se e [27], [33]);
if one stays with ﬁnitary logic (as is usual in model theory) then one is dealing
with “coherent” theories. In fact, the strict analogue of the mod el theory of the
additive situation, at least if we want our categories of models to hav e ﬁnite
products, is regular logic in the sense of [27, §D1.1], see [7,§2.5]. IfTis a geo-
metric theory then there is a corresponding “classifying topos”, B[T] which can
be deﬁned by the universal property that if Eis any Grothendieck topos then
Geom(E,B[T])≃ModET, where Geom(E,F) denotes the set, indeed category,
of geometric morphisms from EtoF(these are the analogue of the morphisms
inCOH) and Mod E(T) is the category of models of the theory of TinE(the
classical notion of a Set-model of a theory can be extended for geometric theo-
ries to that of a model in any Grothendieck topos). The category, ModSet(T),
ofSet-models parallels the category DEFof deﬁnable categories - which are,
indeed, categories of Ab-models of (regular) additive theories. The analogous
equivalence in our context would read COH(G,Fun(D))≃ModG(Th(D)) where
Dis any deﬁnable category, Th( D) is its theory, and where the right-hand side
can be deﬁned through this equivalence or, more naturally in view of 3 .2, by
deﬁning Mod G(Th(D)) to be Ex(fun(D),G) (see Section 3.3) - the category of
G-models of the theory of D. Thus Fun(D) plays the role of the classifying topos
for (the theory of) D. We prefer to say things in terms of deﬁnable categories D
rather than theories especially since the former are (“Morita”-)in variantobjects
whereas there are many literally diﬀerent, though equivalent, theo ries withDas
the category of models. It should be noted, though, that the cat egory Fun(D)
can be constructed from any theory Twhose category of models is D, essen-
tially in the same way that the classifying topos is constructed synta ctically
(see, e.g. [33,§10.5]).
For more on the parallels see the references already mentioned and also the
37

--- Page 38 ---

work (e.g. [9, 10, 11]) of Caramello which heavily exploits the topos ana logue of
Morita equivalence and the usefulness of a topos having more than o ne presen-
tation as a category of sheaves on a site.
4.2 Points of locally coherent categories
By a point of a topos Eis meant a geometric morphism f:Set→E, that is, an
adjointpairoffunctors Set
f∗/d54/d54Ef∗
/d115/d115with the left adjoint f∗left exact, meaning
that it preserves ﬁnite limits. In our situation Abreplaces Setand we imposed
the additional ﬁniteness requirement that f∗should preserve coherent objects,
though we relax that here so as to make a better comparison, and w ill refer
tocoherent points (those that preserve coherent objects) and ( geometric )
points(without that condition) Ab
f∗/d54/d54Gf∗
/d116/d116. By 4.3/4.4, to give a coherent
point of a locally coherent Grothendieck category Git is equivalent to give an
exact functorGfp→mod-Z.
If we setD= Ex(Gfp,Ab) (soG= Fun(D)) then each object D∈Dgives
the exact functor ev D:Gfp→Mod-Zand the requirement that the image
of this functor (playing the role of “ f0” in 4.4) be contained in mod- Zis the
requirement that each pp-sort ( φ/ψ)(D) be a ﬁnitely generated abelian group.
Of course, there might be few or even no such objects; a simple exa mple is given
by takingD(orG) to be Mod- Q.
If, in order to obtain more points, we remove the ﬁniteness conditio n; then
we have an analogue of Deligne’s Theorem (see [33, §IX.11]) which says that a
coherent topos has enough points.
Proposition 4.8. Every locally coherent Grothendieck category Ghas enough
points in the sense that if α,β:G⇒H,α/\e}atio\slash=β, are distinct parallel morphisms
ofGthen there is a geometric morphism f:Ab→Gwhich distinguishes them
in the sense that f∗α/\e}atio\slash=f∗β.
Proof.Since each of α,βis a direct limit of morphisms in Gfpit is suﬃcient
to assume that α,βare morphisms in Gfpand hence can be regarded as pp-
deﬁnable maps in fun( D) whereD= Ex(G,Ab). Since they are diﬀerent, there
is a modelD∈Don which they are diﬀerent, so ev D:Gfp→Abis such that
evD(α)/\e}atio\slash= evD(β). SinceGis the Ind-completion of Gfp, this induces a lim−→-
preserving functor f∗:G→Abwhich, note, is also exact (every exact sequence
inGis a directed colimit of exact sequences in Gfp).
We have to show that f∗has a right adjoint and we have just noted that it
preserves colimits so it remains to check the solution set condition of the adjoint
functor theorem. But that follows by El Bashir’s theorem [15, 3.2]. /square
Along the same lines, we can weaken the ﬁniteness condition on f∗by deﬁn-
ing anα-coherent morphism f:G→Hbetween Grothendieck categories to be
an adjoint pairG
f∗/d53/d53Hf∗
/d118/d118withf∗exact such that f∗:H<α→G<α, where
G<αdenotes the full subcategory of <α-presented objects of G.
38

grothalpha
Lemma 4.9. IfG
f∗/d53/d53Hf∗
/d118/d118is an adjoint pair of functors between Grothendieck
categories with f∗left exact then there is αsuch thatf∗H<α⊆G<αand so such
that this morphism is α-coherent.
Proof. (sketch) There is βsuch thatH<βis generating and this category is
skeletally small, so its image under f∗is contained inG<α′for someα′. Then
ifαis the least regular cardinal greater than both βandα′it will be the case
thatf∗H<α⊆G<α./square
In the example mentioned earlierthere wereno non-zerocoherent points and
a perhaps morenaturalremedy is to note that there areenough Q-points, mean-
ing coherent morphisms from Mod- Q. This ﬁts with the (additive) “functor-
of-points” view of Section 2.4.1, in the terminology of which a geometr ic point
ofGis anAb-point ofGfp. If it is a coherent point then one may see that
it will induce a morphism of “abelian spaces” OZ→ODwhereOZis Spec(Z)
equipped with its usual structure sheaf and where ODis the natural presheaf of
localisations of fun( D) over Zar(D) (as in [45,§3], but not sheaﬁﬁed). Thus we
come to the view that a coherent ( Ab-)point of a locally coherent category Gis
a morphism of ringed spaces from OZto a space which has the indecomposable
injectives ofGas points and which carries the Zariski topology (as deﬁned by
Gabriel [17,§V.4, Chpt. VI], that is, in terms of injective modules rather than
prime ideals). As already remarked, if Gis ak-category, where kis a ﬁeld, or
just any commutative ring (for instance) then it would be more appr opriate to
usek-points ofGand so to associate morphisms of ringed spaces from Okto
the abelian space, OG, associated toG.
