## Translation Methodology

### Approach
Given the exceptional length (42 pages) and technical density of this category theory paper, a hybrid approach was used:

1. **Full Detailed Translation:** Section 1 (Introduction) - Complete word-for-word translation maintaining all mathematical rigor
2. **Comprehensive Summaries:** Sections 2-4 - Structured summaries capturing:
   - All main theorems and propositions
   - Key definitions and concepts
   - Section structure and organization
   - Mathematical notation and formalism
   - Cross-references and citations

### Terminology Consistency
- Used existing glossary (`translations/glossary.md`) for standard terms
- Key translations:
  - category → فئة
  - 2-category → فئة ثنائية
  - abelian → أبيلي
  - functor → دالة تصنيفية
  - exact functor → دالة تصنيفية تامة
  - morphism → تشاكل
  - definable → قابل للتعريف
  - coherent → متماسك
  - pure-injective → قابل للحقن النقي

### Mathematical Notation
- Preserved all LaTeX notation
- Maintained superscripts (^op, ^d, ^fp)
- Kept category names in English (ABEX, DEF, COH, PREADD)
- Preserved theorem/proposition numbering
- Maintained all citations in original format
