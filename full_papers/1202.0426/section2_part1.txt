2 The category of small abelian categories and
exact functors
The category ABEX, of skeletally small abelian categories and exact functors,
belongs to algebra but it has a model-theoretic meaning (its objects are the
categoriesof pp-sorts and pp-deﬁnable functions for the corre spondingdeﬁnable
categories, see [43, Chpt. 22] or [42, Part III], also [44]). It can als o be seen as
generalising the category of rings through the free abelian catego ryconstruction
but also through a possibly more geometric construction (see Sect ion 2.4.2).
Recall that an exactfunctorF:A→B between abelian categories is a
functor such that if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is an exact sequence in Athen
0→FA′→FA→FA′′→0 is an exact sequence in B. By the kernelof such a
functor we mean the full subcategory ker( F) on the objects{A∈A:FA= 0}
which are sent to 0 by F. This is a Serre subcategory ofA, meaning a
full subcategorySofAwhich is closed under subobjects, quotient objects and
extensions: otherwise said, if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is exact then A∈S
iﬀA′,A′′∈S. Conversely every Serre subcategory Sis the kernel of an exact
functor fromA. Alocalisation ofAis an exact functor F:A→Bwhich
is such that the image of Fis full and includes an isomorphic copy of every
object inB; that is, up to equivalence Bis the image of F. We deﬁne the
quotient category ofAat the Serre subcategory Sto have the same objects
asAbut deﬁne the morphisms from AtoBinA/Sto be equivalence classes of
morphisms from subobjects A′ofA, withA/A′∈S, to factor objects B/B′of
B, withB′∈S, under a natural (eventual agreement) equivalence relation. Se e,
for instance, [49, §IX.1], for details but the idea is simply that one forces the
objects inSto become zero. If F:A→Bis a localisation then Bis equivalent
toA/ker(F) andFhas a right adjoint which is a full, though not in general
exact, embedding iofBinA. Thus the image of iis a reﬂective subcategory
ofA. We write/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htfor the Serre subcategory generated by a collection Xof
objects ofA. We also write Ser( A) for the set of Serre subcategories of A.
We will need the following theorem, the ﬁrst paragraph of which is [16, 4.1]
(for fuller references see [42, §10.2.7] or [43,§4]).

Theorem 2.1. LetRbe a skeletally small preadditive category. Then there is
an additive functor ifromRto a skeletally small abelian category Ab(R)such
that ifα:R→Bis any additive functor to an abelian category Bthen there
is a factorisation through ivia a unique-to-natural-equivalence exact functor
Ab(R)→B.

The category Ab(R)may be identiﬁed with (R-mod,Ab)fp≃/parenleftbig
(mod-R,Ab)fp/parenrightbigop
and the embedding itakes an object PofRto((P,−),−)and has the then ob-
vious action on morphisms.
Corollary 2.2. IfRis a skeletally small preadditive category then Ab(Rop)≃
Ab(R)op.
The category Ab( R), more precisely the functor R→Ab(R), given by 2.1
is thefree abelian category onR. In the case that we start with a ring R,
that is a preadditive category with one object ∗Rwhich has endomorphism ring
R, the image of that object in Ab( R) is the representable functor (( ∗R,−),−)
on the representable functor ( ∗R,−)∈R-mod (this latter being the projective
left module RR).
Note that, taking B=Aband allowing αto roam over all (covariant) func-
tors, i.e. leftR-modules, weobtainthat R-Modisequivalent toEx(Ab( R),Ab).
ReplacingRbyRopto get the contravariant form, and noting 2.2, we have
Mod-R≃Ex(Ab(R)op,Ab).
If a ringRis von Neumann regular then Ab( R)≃mod-R, indeed these
are exactly the rings for which this is true (see, e.g., [42, 10.2.38] (wh ere the
statement is missing anop)).
2.1 Categorical properties of ABEX
IfA,B∈ABEXthen Ex(A,B) is a skeletally small category with objects the
exact functors from AtoBand with morphisms the natural transformations
between these. It isa preadditivecategory: for F,G∈Ex(A,B) the set (F,G) =
Nat(F,G) of natural transformations from FtoGis an abelian group with
0∈Nat(F,G) being given by 0 A= 0 :FA→GAfor each object A∈Aand,
ifτ,µ∈Nat(F,G) thenτ−µis deﬁned at A∈Aby (τ−µ)A=τA−µA:
FA→GA. Indeed, Ex(A,B) is additive: for a zero object, choose a zero object
0B∈Band deﬁne the functor 0 : A→BbyA/mapsto→0Bfor allA∈A. And if
F,G∈Ex(A,B) then we may, since Bhas ﬁnite direct sums, deﬁne F⊕Gby
takingA∈AtoFA⊕GAandf:A→A′to(Ff,Gf) :FA⊕GA→FA′⊕GA′.
ThusABEXmay be seen as a category enriched in additive categories.
Example 2.3.(A,B) need not be abelian.
LetRbe right coherent, so mod- R∈ABEXand Ex(mod- R,Ab)≃R-Flat,
the category of ﬂat left R-modules (see 1.3). In particular Ex(mod- Z,Ab)≃
Z-Flat (∗) and, we claim, Ex(mod- Z,mod-Z)≃Z-Flat∩Z-mod =Z-proj, the
category of ﬁnitely generated projective Z-modules, which is not abelian. To
5

--- Page 6 ---

see the claim we just use that in the equivalence ( ∗) a ﬂat module Mon the
right-hand side of the equivalence acts on mod- Zas the (exact) functor −⊗M;
it is clear that if such a functor outputs only ﬁnitely presented value s thenM
is ﬁnitely presented, and conversely.
Bearing in mind that ABEXis a 2-category, so equality is generally replaced
by natural equivalence, we will say that an exact functor F:A→BinABEX
is amonomorphism if for allG,H:A′→Aifτ:FG→FHis a natural
isomorphism then there is a natural isomorphism η:G→Hsuch thatτ=Fη.
Lemma 2.4. For everyA∈ABEXandA∈Athere is a morphism Ab(Z)→A
inABEXsuch that the single object, ((∗Z,−),−), of the image of ZinAb(Z)
(2.1) is taken to A(and hence the ring, Z, of endomorphisms of ∗Zis taken to
its natural image in End(A)).
Proof.Deﬁne thefunctor bytaking ∗=∗ZtoA(andextending1 Z= id∗/mapsto→idA
to a ring homomorphism) and then we have an extension to an exact f unctor
(unique to natural equivalence) Ab( Z)→Aby 2.1. /square
Lemma 2.5. IfF:A→Bis a monomorphism in ABEXthenFis full on
isomorphisms in the strong sense that if g:FA1→FA2is an isomorphism then
there is an isomorphism f:A1→A2such thatFf=g. This second condition
onFis equivalent to Fbeing faithful and every isomorphism g:FA1→FA2
being the image of some morphism A1→A2.
Proof.Suppose that A1,A2∈Aand thatg:FA1→FA2is an isomorphismin
B. LetGi: Ab(Z)→Abe as in the lemma above, taking ∗=∗ZtoAi; then, by
2.1, we deduce that there is a natural isomorphism τ:FG1→FG2essentially
determined by τ∗=gso, by assumption, there is a natural isomorphism η:
G1→G2, in particular an isomorphism η∗:A1→A2, such that Fη∗=g, as
required.
For the equivalent condition, recall that a functor Fisfaithful if whenever
f,f′:A1→A2are in its domain and Ff=Ff′thenf=f′. In the case of
an additive functor, one replaces the pair f,f′byf−f′,0 and the condition
becomesFf= 0 implies f= 0. In the case that Fis an exact functor between
abelian categories then, since F(co)ker(f) = (co)ker( Ff), one deduces that F
is faithful iﬀ the object kernel is zero, that is iﬀ FA= 0 implies A= 0. So
ifFreﬂects isomorphism , meaning that FA1≃FA2impliesA1≃A2then
Fis faithful. For the converse, if g:FA1→FA2is an isomorphism then, by
assumption, there is a morphism f:A1→A2withg=Ff. If either ker( f)
or coker(f) were non-zero then, by exactness and faithfulness of F,Ffwould
have a non-zero kernel or cokernel, contradiction. So fis an isomorphism. /square
Proposition 2.6. The following are equivalent for a morphism F:A→Bin
ABEX:
(i)Fis monic in ABEX;
(ii)Fis full on isomorphisms in the strong sense of 2.5
(iii)Fis faithful and full on isomorphisms.
Proof.(i)⇔(ii) One direction is the lemma above. For the other suppose that
Fis full on isomorphisms in the strong sense and that we have G,H:A′→A
6

and a natural equivalence τ:FG→FH. So for each A′∈A′we have an
isomorphism τA′:FGA′→FHA′; by assumption there is an isomorphism
which we will denote ηA′:GA′→HA′such thatFηA′=τA′. We have to show
that theηA′ﬁt together to form a natural transformation from GtoH.
Givenf:A′→A′′inAwe consider the diagram

/d15/d15HA′

/d15/d15

and the diﬀerence Hf.ηA′−ηA′′.Gf; applyFto obtain the diagram
FGA′FηA′=τA′/d47/d47
GGf

FGA′′
FηA′′=τA′′/d47/d47FHA′′
which commutes, that is F(Hf.ηA′−ηA′′.Gf) = 0, so it will suﬃce to show that
the kernel of Fin the sense of arrows is zero. But we have this from (the proof
of) 2.5, which also gives us the equivalence of (ii) and (iii). /square
So a monomorphism in ABEXis, in particular, an embedding of an abelian
(i.e. exact) subcategory and any such embedding which is full (e.g. t he embed-
ding of the category of ﬁnite abelian groups in the category of ﬁnite ly generated
ones) is a monomorphism.
Example 2.7.A monomorphism in ABEXneed not be a kernel.
LetRbe a tame hereditary ﬁnite-dimensional algebra, set B= mod-Rand
letAbe the full, abelian, subcategory of regular modules. Then A→Bis a
morphism in ABEXand is a full embedding so certainly is a monomorphism
inABEX. If it were the kernel of an exact functor then Awould be a Serre
subcategory - not so since RRembeds in a regular module and so the Serre
subcategory generated by Ais all ofB.
Example 2.8.A monomorphism in ABEXneed not be full. Consider the non-
full functor F: mod-k→mod-kA2, whereA2is the quiver•→•, which takes
kkto thekA2-modulekA2. IfP,Qare in the image of F, that is, are ﬁnitely
generated free kA2-modules, then it is easily computed that any isomorphism
P→Qis in the image of F. So, by 2.6, Fis a monomorphism in ABEXbut
clearlyFis not full.
Example 2.9.Consider the functor mod- kA2→mod-kwhich takes a represen-
tationV1αV−−→V2of the quiver A2toV1⊕V2and which has the obvious action
on morphisms (i.e. takes ( f1,f2) tof1⊕f2). This functor is clearly exact and
faithful but is not full on isomorphisms hence is not a monomorphism in ABEX.
Say thatF:A→BinABEXis anepimorphism if whenever G,H:B→C
aresuchthat thereisanaturalequivalence τ:GF→HFthen thereisanatural
equivalence µ:G→Hsuch thatµF=τ.
Example 2.10.A morphism F:A→BinABEXwith/a\}bracketle{tFA/a\}bracketri}ht=Bneed not be
an epimorphism.
LetF: mod-(k×k)→mod-kA2be the functor which takes ( V1,V2) to the
representation V10− →V2ofA2and consider the functors Id ,G: mod-k[A2]→
7

--- Page 8 ---

mod-kA2whereGtakes a representation W1α− →W2toW10− →W2. BothFand
Ghave the obvious deﬁnitions on morphisms. It is easily checked that t hese
functors are exact and clearly GF= Id.Fbut there is no natural equivalence
Id→G, soFis not an epimorphism.
On the other hand, each of the two simple representations k→0 and 0→k
ofA2is in the image of Fso, since every object of mod- kA2has ﬁnite length,
the Serre subcategory of mod- k[A2] generated by the image of Fis all of the
category.
We do not have a characterisation of epimorphisms in ABEX, but note the
following.
Proposition 2.11. (1) IfA ∈ABEXandS ∈Ser(A)then the canonical
localisation functor π:A→A/Sis an epimorphism in ABEX.
(2) IfF:A→Bis an epimorphism in ABEXthen the Serre subcategory, /a\}bracketle{tFA/a\}bracketri}ht,
generated by FAisB.
Proof. (1) IfG,H:A/S →Bare such that there is a natural equivalence
τ:Gπ→Hπthen forA∈Awe have an isomorphism τA:GπA→HπA. Since
we may regardA/Sas having objects those of A(but diﬀerent morphisms)
we can deﬁne η:G→Hto have component ηπA=τAatπA. It must be
checked that this is well-deﬁned and that these components coher e to form a
natural transformation. Both come down to showing that if f:πA→πA′
thenHf.τA=τA′.Gf. Butf≃πgfor someg:A1→A′

monomorphism A1→Awith cokernel inSand an epimorphism A′→A′

2.2 Pullbacks in ABEX
We showthat ABEXhas pullbacks, hence a notion of“basechange”(see Section
2.4.2).
Given a diagram
A
F
/d15/d15
BG/d47/d47C
inABEX, we construct the following category P. The objects of Pare triples
(A,B,γ) whereAis an object ofA,Ban object ofBandγ:FA→GB
is an isomorphism in C. A morphism from ( A,B,γ) to (A′,B′,γ′) is a pair
(f:A→A′,g:B→B′) such that γ′.Ff=Gg.γ.
FA
Ff
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB
Gg
/d15/d15
FA′
γ′/d47/d47GB′.
Clearly this gives a category and we have the obvious functors F′:P→B
andG′:P→Awith, for instance, G′taking (A,B,γ) toAand taking ( f,g)
tof. We also have the natural isomorphism FG′⇒GF′with component γat
(A,B,γ), which is a 2-arrow of ABEX. We show thatPis abelian, that F′and
G′are exact and that we have constructed a pullback for the diagram inABEX.
Lemma 2.12.Pis an abelian category and F′,G′are exact.
Proof. We deﬁne addition of morphisms as follows: given ( f,g),(f′,g′) :
(A,B,γ)→(A′B′,γ′) we have the commutative diagrams
FA
Ff
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB
Gg
/d15/d15
FA′
γ′/d47/d47GB′andFA
Ff′
/d15/d15γ/d47/d47GB
Gg′
/d15/d15
FA′
γ′/d47/d47GB′
and henceγ′(Ff+Ff′) =Gg.γ+Gg′.γ= (Gg+Gg′)γ, so deﬁne ( f,g)+(f′g′)
to be (f+f′,g+g′). In this way we have a preadditive category.
It is easy to check that ( A⊕A′,B⊕B′,γ⊕γ′) is the (co)product of ( A,B,γ)
and (A′,B′,γ′) inP.
Given (f,g) : (A,B,γ)→(A′,B′γ′) we have the exact sequences 0 →
ker(f)→Af− →A′→coker(f)→0 and 0→ker(g)→Bg− →B′→coker(g)→0.
SinceFandGare exact these give exact sequences 0 →Fker(f) = ker(Ff)→
FA→FA′and similarly for Gand for the cokernel sequences. Then it is easily
checked that (ker( f),ker(g),γ0) whereγ0is the restriction/corestriction of γ,
is the kernel of ( f,g) and the description of the cokernel is dual. In particu-
lar, (f,g) is a monomorphism, respectively epimorphism, iﬀ both fandgare.
Showing that every monomorphism is a kernel and every epimorphism a cok-
ernel is similar. This also gives the description of exact sequences in P, from
which it is obvious that F′andG′are exact. /square
Theorem 2.13. ABEXhas pullbacks.
9

--- Page 10 ---

Proof.We show thatPconstructed above is the pullback of the diagram we
started with. So suppose that we have a diagram
D
K
/d28/d28H
/d34/d34
PG′/d47/d47
F′
/d15/d15A
F
/d15/d15
BG /d47/d47C
and a natural isomorphism τ:FH→GK. Then we deﬁne L:D→P by
taking an object Dto (HD,KD,τ D) and taking a morphism f:D→D′to
(Hf,Kf), noting that the diagram
FHDτD/d47/d47
FHf
/d15/d15GKD
GKf
/d15/d15
FHD′
τD′/d47/d47GKD′
commutes. It is quickly checked that this functor ﬁlls in the diagram ( with
even strictly commuting triangles) and its uniqueness (to natural is omorphism)
follows using the deﬁnitions of F′andG′. More precisely, if we also have
L′:D→P and natural isomorphisms η:H⇒G′L′,η′:K⇒F′L′then
forD∈D,L′Dhas the form ( G′L′D,F′L′D,δD) whereδD=Gη′
DτD(FηD)−1
(let us ﬁx, because we actually have a cone over the whole diagram, t he arrow
fromDtoCto beGK). So we have a natural isomorphism from LtoL′with
component at DtakingLD= (HD,KD,τ D) toL′D= (G′L′D,F′L′D,δD) by
the pair (ηD,η′
D).
In the 2-categoricalcontext, the notion ofpullback (and more ge neral limits)
usually requires more, namely we must show that if we have two such c ones at
Dover the initial diagram, say
DH/d47/d47
