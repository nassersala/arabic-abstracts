1 Introduction
This paper is about three 2-categories which sit an an intersection o f algebra,
model theory and geometry (the last in the broad sense).
Oneofthesecategories, ABEX, hasforits objectstheskeletallysmallabelian
categories and for its morphisms the exact functors; another, DEF, is the cat-
egory of deﬁnable additive categories and interpretation functor s; the third is
the category, COH, of locally coherent Grothendieck categories and coherent
1
morphisms. In each case the 2-arrowsare just the natural tran sformations. The
(anti-)equivalences between these were described in [45], which build s on [43]
and [30], and are recalled below (see also [34] and [25] for analogous re sults).
Here these categories and their connections are explored furthe r.
I have tried to include enough explanation of background to make th e paper
accessible to a variety of readers; for more details one should cons ult the various
referencescited. I will use [42] as a convenientreference since it g atherstogether
much of what I will need but [23], [29], [43] also contain much of that.
Throughoutthispaper,categoriesare,bydefault, preadditive, functormeans
additive functor, ( A,B) will denote the category of additive functors from the
(usually skeletally small) preadditive category Ato the (usually at least addi-
tive) categoryB,Abwill denote the category of abelian groups, Mod- Awill
be an alternative notation for ( Aop,Ab) (whereopdenotes the opposite of a
category) - it is the category of right A-modules - andA-Mod = (A,Ab) will
denote the categoryofleft A-modules. The full subcategoryofﬁnitely presented
modules is denoted by mod- A. We write PREADD for the 2-category of pread-
ditive categories (additive functors and natural transformation s). We scarcely
distinguish between a skeletally small category and a small version of it (i.e. a
category to which it is equivalent but which has just a set of objects ).
Now we show how the three 2-categories are related, then give a qu ick sum-
mary of what is in each section.
Theorem 1.1. [45, 2.3 and comments following] There is a diagram of equiv-
alences and anti-equivalences between ABEX,COHandDEFas follows.

Explicitly:

/d39/d39D= Abs(G) = Ex(A,Ab) /d110/d110
/d115/d115
G= Flat-A= Fun(D)/d103/d103 /d51/d51
We will need the details of these (anti-)equivalences, so here they a re.
FromABEXtoDEF: to a skeletally small abelian category Awe associate
the deﬁnable category Ex( A,Ab) - the full subcategory of A-Mod on those
functors which are exact; to an exact functor F:A→B, we associate the
functorF∗: Ex(B,Ab)→Ex(A,Ab) which is just precomposition with F.
FromDEFtoABEX: to a deﬁnable category Dwe associate the category,
fun(D) = (D,Ab)→/producttext
, of functors from Dwhich commute with direct limits
and direct products (we write fun- Rin the case that D= Mod-R); to an
interpretation functor, that is, a functor I:C→Dwhich commutes with direct
products and direct limits, we associate the functor I0: fun(D)→fun(C) which
is precomposition with I.

Between ABEXandCOH(on objects): to a locally coherent Grothendieck
categoryGwe assign its full subcategory, Gfp, of ﬁnitely presented objects;
in the other direction, to a skeletally small abelian category Awe assign the
category Lex(Aop,Ab) of left exact functors on Aop, thus right exact functors
onA, so this includes the representable functors ( −,A) forA∈A. This is
a locally coherent Grothendieck category and the image of Aunder the just-
mentioned Yoneda embedding A/mapsto→(−,A) is equivalent to the full subcategory
of ﬁnitely presented objects (see 4.1, also for the identiﬁcations L ex(Aop,Ab)≃
Flat-A≃Ind(A)).
Between ABEXandCOH(on morphisms): from a morphism f∈Ex(A,B)
we deﬁne the coherent morphism (see Section 4) ( f∗,f∗) :H= Ind(B)→
Ind(A) =Gwhich has f∗:H= Lex(Bop,Ab)→Lex(Aop,Ab) =Gjust
precomposition with fopand hasf∗= Ind(f). In the other direction we take
a coherent morphism ( f∗,f∗) to the restriction of the left adjoint, f∗, to the
ﬁnitely presented objects of G.
The as-yet-unexplained notation Abs( G) refers to the full subcategory of
absolutely pure (orfp-injective ) objects ofG- those objects Gsuch that
Ext1(Gfp,G) = 0.
The next result, which is not diﬃcult to show (or see [44]), is one instan ce of
this picture. ByA(R) we denote the smallest abelian (not necessarily full) sub-
category of Mod-Rwhich contains mod- R(see [45,§6], also Section 2.4 below).
By/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htwe denote the smallest deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- RcontainingX.
Proposition 1.2. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R)op,Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tAbs-R/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so Abs-Ris a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod-R, then
Ex((mod -R)op,Ab)≃Abs-R.
Note the duality which applies to the whole picture described above. I t is
obvious for ABEX, on which it is the 2-category equivalence which takes each
abelian category to its opposite. It follows that there is a correspo nding self-
equivalence on each of the other two categories (which will be descr ibed in the
relevant section). In the context of the model theory of deﬁnab le subcategories
of module categories this duality was found ﬁrst for pp formulas, an d termed
elementary duality ([39]) then extended to the category of pp-pair s and the
Ziegler spectrum in [22]. In an algebraic form it is in [5] and [21].
For instance, the dual to the result above is the following.
Proposition 1.3. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R),Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tR-Flat/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so A(R) = mod-RandR-Flatis a deﬁnable subcategory
ofR-Mod, then
Ex(mod-R,Ab)≃R-Flat.
In Section 2 we identify the ﬁnitely presented objects of ABEXas the ﬁnite
type localisations of free abelian categories of ﬁnitely presented rin gs and we
3
show that every small abelian category is a direct limit - “directed colim it” in
the more category-theoretic terminology - of such categories. S inceABEXalso
has directed colimits in a suitable 2-category sense we could therefo re say that
ABEXis ﬁnitely accessible (in some 2-category sense). We show that ABEX
has pullbacks and also characterise the monomorphisms (and say a lit tle about
the epimorphisms) of this category.
The main result of Section 3 is that the structure of DEF- arrows and 2-
arrows as well as the objects - is essentially determined by the full s ubcategories
of pure-injective objects. We also show that if Ais skeletally small abelian then
Ex(A,D) is deﬁnable for any deﬁnable Grothendieck (so, 3.6, locally ﬁnitely
presented) category D(not just whenD=Ab).
Section 4 is devoted to developing an additive version of things (cohe r-
ent morphisms, classifying toposes, points) that are familiar in the c ontext of
toposes. The parallel is well-known but we develop it further here as part of the
larger additive picture.
2 The category of small abelian categories and
exact functors
The category ABEX, of skeletally small abelian categories and exact functors,
belongs to algebra but it has a model-theoretic meaning (its objects are the
categoriesof pp-sorts and pp-deﬁnable functions for the corre spondingdeﬁnable
categories, see [43, Chpt. 22] or [42, Part III], also [44]). It can als o be seen as
generalising the category of rings through the free abelian catego ryconstruction
but also through a possibly more geometric construction (see Sect ion 2.4.2).
Recall that an exactfunctorF:A→B between abelian categories is a
functor such that if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is an exact sequence in Athen
0→FA′→FA→FA′′→0 is an exact sequence in B. By the kernelof such a
functor we mean the full subcategory ker( F) on the objects{A∈A:FA= 0}
which are sent to 0 by F. This is a Serre subcategory ofA, meaning a
full subcategorySofAwhich is closed under subobjects, quotient objects and
extensions: otherwise said, if 0 →A′→A→A′′→0 is exact then A∈S
iﬀA′,A′′∈S. Conversely every Serre subcategory Sis the kernel of an exact
functor fromA. Alocalisation ofAis an exact functor F:A→Bwhich
is such that the image of Fis full and includes an isomorphic copy of every
object inB; that is, up to equivalence Bis the image of F. We deﬁne the
quotient category ofAat the Serre subcategory Sto have the same objects
asAbut deﬁne the morphisms from AtoBinA/Sto be equivalence classes of
morphisms from subobjects A′ofA, withA/A′∈S, to factor objects B/B′of
B, withB′∈S, under a natural (eventual agreement) equivalence relation. Se e,
for instance, [49, §IX.1], for details but the idea is simply that one forces the
objects inSto become zero. If F:A→Bis a localisation then Bis equivalent
toA/ker(F) andFhas a right adjoint which is a full, though not in general
exact, embedding iofBinA. Thus the image of iis a reﬂective subcategory
ofA. We write/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htfor the Serre subcategory generated by a collection Xof
objects ofA. We also write Ser( A) for the set of Serre subcategories of A.
We will need the following theorem, the ﬁrst paragraph of which is [16, 4.1]
(for fuller references see [42, §10.2.7] or [43,§4]).

Theorem 2.1. LetRbe a skeletally small preadditive category. Then there is
an additive functor ifromRto a skeletally small abelian category Ab(R)such
that ifα:R→Bis any additive functor to an abelian category Bthen there
is a factorisation through ivia a unique-to-natural-equivalence exact functor
Ab(R)→B.

The category Ab(R)may be identiﬁed with (R-mod,Ab)fp≃/parenleftbig
(mod-R,Ab)fp/parenrightbigop
and the embedding itakes an object PofRto((P,−),−)and has the then ob-
vious action on morphisms.
Corollary 2.2. IfRis a skeletally small preadditive category then Ab(Rop)≃
Ab(R)op.
The category Ab( R), more precisely the functor R→Ab(R), given by 2.1
is thefree abelian category onR. In the case that we start with a ring R,
that is a preadditive category with one object ∗Rwhich has endomorphism ring
R, the image of that object in Ab( R) is the representable functor (( ∗R,−),−)
on the representable functor ( ∗R,−)∈R-mod (this latter being the projective
left module RR).
Note that, taking B=Aband allowing αto roam over all (covariant) func-
tors, i.e. leftR-modules, weobtainthat R-Modisequivalent toEx(Ab( R),Ab).
ReplacingRbyRopto get the contravariant form, and noting 2.2, we have
Mod-R≃Ex(Ab(R)op,Ab).
If a ringRis von Neumann regular then Ab( R)≃mod-R, indeed these
are exactly the rings for which this is true (see, e.g., [42, 10.2.38] (wh ere the
statement is missing anop)).
2.1 Categorical properties of ABEX
IfA,B∈ABEXthen Ex(A,B) is a skeletally small category with objects the
exact functors from AtoBand with morphisms the natural transformations
between these. It isa preadditivecategory: for F,G∈Ex(A,B) the set (F,G) =
Nat(F,G) of natural transformations from FtoGis an abelian group with
0∈Nat(F,G) being given by 0 A= 0 :FA→GAfor each object A∈Aand,
ifτ,µ∈Nat(F,G) thenτ−µis deﬁned at A∈Aby (τ−µ)A=τA−µA:
FA→GA. Indeed, Ex(A,B) is additive: for a zero object, choose a zero object
0B∈Band deﬁne the functor 0 : A→BbyA/mapsto→0Bfor allA∈A. And if
F,G∈Ex(A,B) then we may, since Bhas ﬁnite direct sums, deﬁne F⊕Gby
takingA∈AtoFA⊕GAandf:A→A′to(Ff,Gf) :FA⊕GA→FA′⊕GA′.
ThusABEXmay be seen as a category enriched in additive categories.
Example 2.3.(A,B) need not be abelian.
LetRbe right coherent, so mod- R∈ABEXand Ex(mod- R,Ab)≃R-Flat,
the category of ﬂat left R-modules (see 1.3). In particular Ex(mod- Z,Ab)≃
Z-Flat (∗) and, we claim, Ex(mod- Z,mod-Z)≃Z-Flat∩Z-mod =Z-proj, the
category of ﬁnitely generated projective Z-modules, which is not abelian. To
