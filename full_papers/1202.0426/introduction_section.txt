4.2 Points of locally coherent categories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38
1 Introduction
This paper is about three 2-categories which sit an an intersection o f algebra,
model theory and geometry (the last in the broad sense).
Oneofthesecategories, ABEX, hasforits objectstheskeletallysmallabelian
categories and for its morphisms the exact functors; another, DEF, is the cat-
egory of deﬁnable additive categories and interpretation functor s; the third is
the category, COH, of locally coherent Grothendieck categories and coherent

morphisms. In each case the 2-arrowsare just the natural tran sformations. The
(anti-)equivalences between these were described in [45], which build s on [43]
and [30], and are recalled below (see also [34] and [25] for analogous re sults).
Here these categories and their connections are explored furthe r.
I have tried to include enough explanation of background to make th e paper
accessible to a variety of readers; for more details one should cons ult the various
referencescited. I will use [42] as a convenientreference since it g atherstogether
much of what I will need but [23], [29], [43] also contain much of that.
Throughoutthispaper,categoriesare,bydefault, preadditive, functormeans
additive functor, ( A,B) will denote the category of additive functors from the
(usually skeletally small) preadditive category Ato the (usually at least addi-
tive) categoryB,Abwill denote the category of abelian groups, Mod- Awill
be an alternative notation for ( Aop,Ab) (whereopdenotes the opposite of a
category) - it is the category of right A-modules - andA-Mod = (A,Ab) will
denote the categoryofleft A-modules. The full subcategoryofﬁnitely presented
modules is denoted by mod- A. We write PREADD for the 2-category of pread-
ditive categories (additive functors and natural transformation s). We scarcely
distinguish between a skeletally small category and a small version of it (i.e. a
category to which it is equivalent but which has just a set of objects ).
Now we show how the three 2-categories are related, then give a qu ick sum-
mary of what is in each section.
Theorem 1.1. [45, 2.3 and comments following] There is a diagram of equiv-
alences and anti-equivalences between ABEX,COHandDEFas follows.

Explicitly:
A= fun(D) =Gfp/d46/d46
/d39/d39D= Abs(G) = Ex(A,Ab) /d110/d110
/d115/d115
G= Flat-A= Fun(D)/d103/d103 /d51/d51
We will need the details of these (anti-)equivalences, so here they a re.
FromABEXtoDEF: to a skeletally small abelian category Awe associate
the deﬁnable category Ex( A,Ab) - the full subcategory of A-Mod on those
functors which are exact; to an exact functor F:A→B, we associate the
functorF∗: Ex(B,Ab)→Ex(A,Ab) which is just precomposition with F.
FromDEFtoABEX: to a deﬁnable category Dwe associate the category,
fun(D) = (D,Ab)→/producttext
, of functors from Dwhich commute with direct limits
and direct products (we write fun- Rin the case that D= Mod-R); to an
interpretation functor, that is, a functor I:C→Dwhich commutes with direct
products and direct limits, we associate the functor I0: fun(D)→fun(C) which
is precomposition with I.

Between ABEXandCOH(on objects): to a locally coherent Grothendieck
categoryGwe assign its full subcategory, Gfp, of ﬁnitely presented objects;
in the other direction, to a skeletally small abelian category Awe assign the
category Lex(Aop,Ab) of left exact functors on Aop, thus right exact functors
onA, so this includes the representable functors ( −,A) forA∈A. This is
a locally coherent Grothendieck category and the image of Aunder the just-
mentioned Yoneda embedding A/mapsto→(−,A) is equivalent to the full subcategory
of ﬁnitely presented objects (see 4.1, also for the identiﬁcations L ex(Aop,Ab)≃
Flat-A≃Ind(A)).
Between ABEXandCOH(on morphisms): from a morphism f∈Ex(A,B)
we deﬁne the coherent morphism (see Section 4) ( f∗,f∗) :H= Ind(B)→
Ind(A) =Gwhich has f∗:H= Lex(Bop,Ab)→Lex(Aop,Ab) =Gjust
precomposition with fopand hasf∗= Ind(f). In the other direction we take
a coherent morphism ( f∗,f∗) to the restriction of the left adjoint, f∗, to the
ﬁnitely presented objects of G.
The as-yet-unexplained notation Abs( G) refers to the full subcategory of
absolutely pure (orfp-injective ) objects ofG- those objects Gsuch that
Ext1(Gfp,G) = 0.
The next result, which is not diﬃcult to show (or see [44]), is one instan ce of
this picture. ByA(R) we denote the smallest abelian (not necessarily full) sub-
category of Mod-Rwhich contains mod- R(see [45,§6], also Section 2.4 below).
By/a\}bracketle{tX/a\}bracketri}htwe denote the smallest deﬁnable subcategory of Mod- RcontainingX.
Proposition 1.2. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R)op,Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tAbs-R/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so Abs-Ris a deﬁnable subcategory of Mod-R, then
Ex((mod -R)op,Ab)≃Abs-R.
Note the duality which applies to the whole picture described above. I t is
obvious for ABEX, on which it is the 2-category equivalence which takes each
abelian category to its opposite. It follows that there is a correspo nding self-
equivalence on each of the other two categories (which will be descr ibed in the
relevant section). In the context of the model theory of deﬁnab le subcategories
of module categories this duality was found ﬁrst for pp formulas, an d termed
elementary duality ([39]) then extended to the category of pp-pair s and the
Ziegler spectrum in [22]. In an algebraic form it is in [5] and [21].
For instance, the dual to the result above is the following.
Proposition 1.3. IfRis any skeletally small preadditive category then
Ex(A(R),Ab)≃/a\}bracketle{tR-Flat/a\}bracketri}ht.
IfRis right coherent, so A(R) = mod-RandR-Flatis a deﬁnable subcategory
ofR-Mod, then
Ex(mod-R,Ab)≃R-Flat.
In Section 2 we identify the ﬁnitely presented objects of ABEXas the ﬁnite
type localisations of free abelian categories of ﬁnitely presented rin gs and we

show that every small abelian category is a direct limit - “directed colim it” in
the more category-theoretic terminology - of such categories. S inceABEXalso
has directed colimits in a suitable 2-category sense we could therefo re say that
ABEXis ﬁnitely accessible (in some 2-category sense). We show that ABEX
has pullbacks and also characterise the monomorphisms (and say a lit tle about
the epimorphisms) of this category.
The main result of Section 3 is that the structure of DEF- arrows and 2-
arrows as well as the objects - is essentially determined by the full s ubcategories
of pure-injective objects. We also show that if Ais skeletally small abelian then
Ex(A,D) is deﬁnable for any deﬁnable Grothendieck (so, 3.6, locally ﬁnitely
presented) category D(not just whenD=Ab).
Section 4 is devoted to developing an additive version of things (cohe r-
ent morphisms, classifying toposes, points) that are familiar in the c ontext of
toposes. The parallel is well-known but we develop it further here as part of the
larger additive picture.
