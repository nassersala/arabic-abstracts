## Paper Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in computer graphics history. Kajiya's rendering equation unified various rendering algorithms under a single mathematical framework and introduced Monte Carlo methods to computer graphics. The paper laid the foundation for modern physically-based rendering and path tracing algorithms used in film production and real-time graphics today.
