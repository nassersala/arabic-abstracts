## Paper Overview

This foundational paper introduces Capsule Networks (CapsNets), a novel neural network architecture that addresses fundamental limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key innovation is the concept of "capsules" - groups of neurons whose activity vectors represent both the probability of an entity's presence and its instantiation parameters (pose, orientation, etc.). The paper presents a dynamic routing-by-agreement mechanism that allows capsules to communicate and form hierarchical representations, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST and demonstrating superior performance on recognizing overlapping digits.
