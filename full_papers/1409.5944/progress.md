## Summary

All 10 sections of the paper have been successfully translated from English to Arabic. The translations maintain:
- Technical accuracy of mathematical and logical concepts
- Formal academic Arabic style
- Consistency with established glossary terms
- The author's pedagogical and expository approach
- Mathematical notation in LaTeX format

The paper presents an accessible proof of a variant of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem using computability theory, avoiding heavy mathematical logic machinery while maintaining rigor.
