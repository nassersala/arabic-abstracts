## Translation Notes

This is a highly technical paper bridging category theory and machine learning. Special attention is needed for:
- Mathematical category theory terminology (functors, morphisms, monads, lenses, optics)
- Machine learning concepts (gradient descent, backpropagation, neural networks)
- Complex mathematical notation and diagrams
- Maintaining consistency with existing glossary terms

The paper requires deep understanding of both category theory and machine learning to ensure accurate translation.
