## Paper Overview

This paper documents the intersection of category theory and machine learning, covering three main areas:
1. **Gradient-based Learning**: Building from automatic differentiation to neural networks and model updates
2. **Probabilistic Methods**: Building from probability foundations to Bayesian models
3. **Invariant and Equivariant Learning**: Characterizing invariances and equivariances of learning algorithms

The paper is a comprehensive survey that aims to provide a unifying categorical perspective on various machine learning approaches.
