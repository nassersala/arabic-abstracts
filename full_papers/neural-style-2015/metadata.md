## Paper Summary
This seminal paper introduces the neural style transfer technique, demonstrating how Deep Neural Networks can separate and recombine the content and style of images. The method uses a pre-trained VGG-19 network to extract content representations from higher layers and style representations (based on Gram matrices) from multiple layers, then optimizes a new image to match both representations simultaneously. This work has become foundational for artistic image generation and has spawned thousands of follow-up works.

## Impact
- One of the most influential papers in neural image synthesis
- Introduced the Gram matrix-based style representation
- Demonstrated content-style separation in deep neural networks
- Highly cited work (20,000+ citations as of 2025)
- Spawned an entire field of neural style transfer research
