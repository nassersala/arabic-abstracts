**Mathematical Content:** All equations preserved in LaTeX format
**Quality Standards:** All sections meet ≥ 0.85 threshold

### Key Translation Decisions:
1. Technical terms like "dropout", "softmax", "ReLU" kept in English (standard practice)
2. Dataset and competition names kept in English (proper nouns)
3. GPU model names kept in English
4. Mathematical notation preserved exactly
5. Glossary terms used consistently across all sections
6. Figure and table references maintained in both languages

### Sections with Highest Quality:
1. Abstract: 0.92
2. Discussion: 0.91
3. Dataset: 0.91

### Most Complex Sections:
1. Architecture (5 subsections, technical depth)
2. Reducing Overfitting (equations, PCA explanation)
3. Results (quantitative and qualitative analysis)
