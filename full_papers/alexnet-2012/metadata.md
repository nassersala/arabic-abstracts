## Paper Significance

This landmark paper introduced AlexNet, the deep convolutional neural network that won the ImageNet LSVRC-2012 competition with a top-5 error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% for the second-best entry. This represented a breakthrough moment for deep learning and sparked the current era of deep neural networks in computer vision.

**Key Contributions:**
- Demonstrated that deep CNNs could achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale image classification
- Introduced ReLU activations for faster training
- Used GPU acceleration for training large networks
- Introduced dropout regularization technique
- Applied data augmentation for reducing overfitting
