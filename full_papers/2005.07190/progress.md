## Translation Notes

### Content Overview
- Paper focuses on industrial application of formal methods (B and Event-B) over 25 years
- Highly technical content with specific domain terminology (railways, smartcards, automotive)
- Contains extensive metrics, case studies, and real-world deployment data
- Covers three main application areas: software, systems, and data validation
- Discusses future technologies: LCHIP platform, advanced proof tools

### Key Technical Terms
- **Core concepts:** formal methods, B method, Event-B, proof obligations, refinement, specification
- **Standards:** SIL4, EAL5+/6+, EN50128, ISO 26262, DO-178C, Common Criteria
- **Tools:** Atelier B, Rodin, ProB, PredicateB, iapa, Why3, Z3, veriT
- **Domains:** railways (metros, signaling), smartcards (EAL certification), automotive (ISO 26262)
- **Metrics:** 100+ metro lines, 300,000 lines of code, 23,000 proof obligations, 2,500 validation rules

### Special Handling
- Company and organization names kept in English (RATP, Alstom, Siemens, STMicroelectronics, etc.)
- Tool names preserved as proper nouns (Atelier B, Rodin, ProB, etc.)
- Standards and certification levels kept as acronyms with Arabic explanations
- Project names maintained in original form (MATISSE, PUSSEE, DEPLOY, RIMEL, etc.)
- Numerical data and metrics preserved exactly
- Footnotes converted to Arabic numbering
- References section summarized with key highlights

### Challenges Addressed
- Highly technical formal methods terminology
- Complex proof theory concepts (proof obligations, refinement, non-determinism)
- Industry-specific railway terminology (interlocking, ATP, CBTC, platform screen doors)
- Multiple European project acronyms
- Balance between technical accuracy and Arabic readability
- Maintaining proper distinction between B method and Event-B

### Quality Assurance
- All sections meet or exceed 0.85 quality threshold ✅
- Consistent use of glossary terms throughout
- Back-translation validation for key technical concepts
- Preservation of all numerical data and metrics
- Proper handling of citations and references
- Maintained academic tone and formal Arabic style
