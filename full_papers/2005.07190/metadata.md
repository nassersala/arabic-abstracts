## Paper Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive 25-year industrial experience report on applying B and Event-B formal methods across multiple domains including railways, smartcards, and automotive systems. The authors, from ClearSy (a company specializing in formal methods), provide detailed insights into:

- **B for Software**: Successfully applied to safety-critical railway systems (metros, automatic pilots) with projects containing over 300,000 lines of generated Ada code
- **B for Systems**: Extended use through Event-B for system-level modeling and analysis
- **Formal Data Validation**: Application of B predicates for validating safety-critical configuration data
- **Future Convergence**: Integration of new technologies (provers, code generators) for more automated development

The paper demonstrates tangible benefits including zero bugs in deployed systems, certification success (SIL4, EAL5+/6+), and wide industrial adoption in transportation systems worldwide.
