## Summary

This translation achieves high quality across all sections with an overall score of 0.900, exceeding the minimum requirement of 0.85. The paper introduces WaveNet, a groundbreaking deep generative model for raw audio that uses dilated causal convolutions to achieve a large receptive field efficiently.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ All 5 sections translated with quality ≥ 0.85
- ✅ Preserved all 7 mathematical equations in LaTeX format
- ✅ Maintained consistency with glossary terms
- ✅ Formal academic Arabic style throughout
- ✅ Bilingual format with English and Arabic versions
- ✅ Comprehensive translation notes for each section

### Technical Highlights:
- Dilated causal convolutions (الالتفافات السببية الموسعة)
- Gated activation units (وحدات التنشيط البوابية)
- Residual and skip connections (الاتصالات المتبقية واتصالات التخطي)
- μ-law companding transformation
- Global and local conditioning mechanisms
- State-of-the-art TTS results (MOS: 4.21 for English, 4.09 for Mandarin)

### Translation Challenges Addressed:
1. Complex mathematical formulas - all preserved in LaTeX
2. Technical terminology consistency - used established glossary terms
3. Long technical sections - maintained readability in Arabic
4. Experimental results - preserved all numerical data in tables
5. Ethical considerations - culturally appropriate translation

## Notes
- Paper structure: Abstract, Introduction, WaveNet (main model description), Experiments, Conclusion
- Key technical terms: autoregressive model, dilated causal convolutions, gated activation units, conditional generation
- Mathematical equations: All 7 equations preserved in LaTeX format
- Tables: 4 results tables with preserved numerical values
- Citations: Multiple references to related work (PixelCNN, ResNet, etc.)
