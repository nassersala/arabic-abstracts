## III. (1992-2017) Broad Industrial Applications and Materials Modeling

The first major event in FEM development this period was the formulation of the Zienkiewicz-Zhu error estimator [1992], which was a major contribution to the mathematical approximation theory of finite element methods in the 1990s. The Zienkiewicz-Zhu posteriori error estimators provide the quality control of a finite element solution with an optimal use of computational resources by refining the mesh adaptively. The idea and spirit of Zienkiewicz-Zhu was further carried out by Ainsworth and Oden [1997] [2000], and today using posteriori error estimation to improve the quality has been elevated to the height of Bayesian inference and Bayesian update. This research topic is now intimately related with what is now called validation and verification (V&V) procedure.

Since the late 1970s, Szabo [1978] and Babuska [1981,1982] started to develop hp version of FEM based on piecewise-polynomial approximations that employ elements of variable size (h) and polynomial degree (p). They discovered that the finite element method converges exponentially when the mesh is refined using a suitable combination of h-refinements (dividing elements into smaller ones) and p-refinements (increasing their polynomial degree). The exponential convergence makes the method a very attractive choice compared to most other finite element methods, which only converge with an algebraic rate. This work continued until the late 1990s, spearheaded by M. Ainsworth, L. Demkowicz, JT. Oden, CAM. Duarte, OC. Zienkiewicz, and CE. Baumann (see Demkowicz et al. (1989) Oden et al. (1989)). J. Fish [1992] also proposed a s-version FEM by superposing additional mesh(es) of higher-order hierarchical elements on top of the original mesh of C0 FEM discretization, so that it increases the resolution of the FEM solution.

To solve material and structural failure problems, research work in the 1990s focused on variational principle based discretized methods to solve fracture mechanics problems or strain localization problems. In 1994, Xu and Needleman developed a finite element cohesive zone model (CZM) that can simulate crack growth without remeshing, which was later further improved by M. Ortiz and his co-workers, who used CZM finite element method to solve fragmentation and material fatigue problems. It should be noted that long before the invention of cohesive zone model, S.T. Pietruszczak and Z. Mroz (1981) developed the first cohesive finite element for shear fracture in soil. Later, Bazant's group at Northwestern University developed various interface finite element methods, such as the microplane model, to study size effects of concrete material and other composite materials (Brocca and Bazant (2001); Caner and Bazant (2009)). Such models became a standard tool for simulating missile impact and explosions at, e.g., ERDA Vicksburg. A microplane FE model for fiber composites has been developed for Chrysler and Ford Co. to compare various designs of automobile crush-cans (Smilauer et al. (2011)). An anisotropic poromechanical microplane model has been formulated and used for FE analysis of hydraulic fracturing (Rahimi et al. (2019)).

To alleviate mesh bias issues in modeling material fracture and damage problems, T. Belytschko and WK. Liu developed meshfree particle methods, namely the element-free Galerkin (EFG) method and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), which are based on the moving least square method and the wavelet multiresolution analysis, respectively. RKPM provides consistency and thus convergence enhancements as compared to the popular smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. S. Li [1999] and others have successfully employed meshfree Galerkin methods to accurately simulate adiabatic shear band formation and propagation with minimum mesh adaptation. At the same time, CA. Duarte and T. Oden developed the so-called hp-Cloud method; E. Onate, S. Idelsohn. OC. Zienkiewicz, and RL. Taylor developed a finite point method [1996], and SN. Atluri and T. Zhu [1998] proposed a meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method, among many other meshfree methods. Fleming and Belytschko also showed that singularity functions could be included in the approximation functions to greatly improve simulations involving fracture mechanics (Fleming et al. (1997)).

One of the most challenging problems in the development of meshfree Galerkin method is how to integrate the weak form, because the meshfree interpolants are highly irregular and it is difficult to make them variational consistent. In 2001, J. S. Chen and his co-workers proposed a stabilized conforming nodal integration method for meshfree RKPM method, which is not only simple and stable, but also variational consistent with the Galerkin weak formulation (Chen et al. (2001)).

Shortly after the meshfree method developments, I. Babuska and his co-workers developed the partition of unity finite element method (PUFEM), which was later coined generalized finite element method (GFEM) (see Melenk and Babuska (1996) and Babuska and Melenk (1997)). PUFEM is a powerful method because it can be used to construct FE spaces of any given regularity, which is a generalization of the h, p, and hp versions of the finite element method, as well as providing the ability to embed an analytic solution into the FEM discretization instead of relying upon a generic polynomial interpolant.

A significant breakthrough in computational fracture mechanics and finite element refinement technology came in the late 1990s, when Ted Belytschko and his co-workers, including T. Black, N. Moes, and J. Dolbow, developed the eXtended finite element (X-FEM) (see Belytschko and Black (1999), and Moës et al. (1999)), which uses various enriched discontinuous shape functions to accurately capture the morphology of a cracked body without remeshing. Because the adaptive enrichment process is governed by the crack tip energy release rate, X-FEM provides an accurate solution for linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). In inventing X-FEM, Ted Belytschko brilliantly utilized the concept PUFEM in solving fracture mechanics problems without remeshing.

Entering the new millennium, A. Karma and his co-workers (Karma et al. [2000]) proposed the phase-field finite element method to solve crack growth and crack propagation problems, as the phase field method can accurately predict material damage for brittle fracture. Some of the leading contributors for this research topic are B. Bourdin, TJR. Hughes, C. Kuhn, R. Muller, C. Miehe, CM. Landis, among others.

As mentioned before, the main reason for the huge success of finite element methods is their broad applicability to engineering analysis and design across scientific disciplines. On the other hand, most mechanical engineering designs are performed by using various computer-aided design (CAD) tools, such as solid modeling. To directly blend the finite element method into CAD design tools, TJR. Hughes and his co-workers such as JA Cottrell and Y. Bazilevs (Hughes et al. (2005), Cottrell et al. (2009)) developed the isogeometric analysis (IGA) finite element method, which established the Galerkin variational weak formulation in the control mesh and uses the Non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) functions as the FEM shape function to solve the problem at design stage.

Due to the emergence of nanotechnology, various multiscale methods have been developed to couple atomistic methods such as molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) and other ab initio methods with continuum scale finite element methods. The most notable contributions in this area are hand-shake method (F.F. Abraham, J. Q. Broughton, N. Bernstein, and E. Kaxiras (1998)), quasi-continuum finite element method (E. B. Tadmor, M. Ortiz, R. Phillips (1996)), and the bridging scale method developed by G. Wagner and WK. Liu (2003), which is an ingenious use of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism in multiscale coupling technique. In 2007, V. Gavini, K. Bhattacharya, and M. Ortiz developed quasi-continuum orbital-free density-functional theory (DFT) finite element formulation for multi-million atom DFT calculations. (Gavini et al. (2007)).

Relatedly, there has been a rapid development in computational homogenization methods since the late 1990s, which is an alternate approach to obtaining continuum-scale properties based on smaller scale microstructures. The computational homogenization method or the finite element homogenization methods for composite materials may be divided into two main categories: (1) Computational asymptotic homogenization method or multiscale computational homogenization, which is aimed for modeling composite materials with periodic microstructure. The pioneer of multiscale homogenization finite element method may be credited to TY Hou and his co-workers (1997), and other earlier contributors are N. Kikuchi, S. Ghosh, J. Fish and M. S. Shephard; and (2) Computational micromechanics method, which is mainly aimed for composite materials with random microstructure, even though it may also be applied to materials with periodic microstructure, where the main contributors are: P. Suquet and his colleagues at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), G. J. Dvorak (1994) and J. Fish at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and C. Miehe (1999) and his group at the University of Stuttgart. During the same period, many novel FEM fluid-structure interaction solvers have been developed, for instance, the immersed finite element method developed by L. Zhang and her co-workers (2004), which was motivated by the immersed boundary method pioneered by C. Peskin of Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University.

An important finite element application area emerged with the developments of computational plasticity. The early finite element computational plasticity formulation is based on hypoelastic-plastic rate formulation. To satisfy the objectivity requirement, TJR Hughes and J. Winget first proposed the so-called incremental objectivity (1980), which was in the first time the esoteric continuum mechanics theory was applied to finite element formulations and computations, and it in turn promoted the development of nonlinear continuum mechanics in 1980s and 1990s. Soon afterwards. Simo and Hughes then extended Hughes-Winget incremental objectivity algorithm to finite deformation case in computational plasticity. The notion of consistency between the tangent stiffness matrix and the integration algorithm employed in the solution of the incremental problem was introduced by Nagtegaal (1982) and Simo and Taylor (1985). Consistent formulations have been subsequently developed for finite deformation plasticity by Simo and Ortiz (1985,1988) within the framework of multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient and hyperelasticity. Also in 1980s, based on the Gurson's model, Tvergaard and Needleman (1984) developed the finite element based Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model, which is probably the most widely used finite element computational plasticity constitutive model used in material modeling, though recently attention has turned to developing machine-learning based or data-driven computational plasticity models e.g., E. Chinesta, et al (2017), and the unsupervised machine learning data-driven finite element methods, call Self-consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA), by Z. Liu et al. (2016, 2018).

An important advance of finite element method is the development of crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), which was first introduced in a landmark paper by D. Peirce, RJ Asaro, and A. Needleman in 1982. In the past almost four decades, there are a numbers of people who have significant contributions to the subject, for example, A. Arsenlis and DM. Parks from MIT and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (1999,2002,2004); PR. Dawson and his colleagues at Cornell University (1989,2011), and D. Raabe and his colleagues at Max-Planck-Institute fur Eisenforschung (2003,2004,2006), among others. Based on crystal slip, CPFEM can calculate dislocation, crystal orientation and other texture information to consider crystal anisotropy during computations, and it has been applied to simulate crystal plasticity deformation, surface roughness, fractures and so on. Recently, S. Li and his co-workers developed a finite element based multiscale dislocation pattern dynamics to model crystal plasticity in single crystal (2019). Yu et al., (2019) reformulated the self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) for general elasto-viscoplastic materials under finite deformation. The accuracy and efficiency for predicting overall mechanical response of polycrystalline materials is demonstrated with a comparison to traditional full-field finite element methods.

In 2013, a group of Italian scientists and engineers led by L. Beirão da Veiga and F. Brezzi proposed a so-called virtual element method (VEM). The virtual element method is an extension of the conventional finite element method for arbitrary element geometries. It allows polytopal discretizations (polygons in 2-D or polyhedra in 3-D), which may be even highly irregular and non-convex element domains. The name "virtual" derives from the fact that knowledge of the local shape function basis is not required, and it is in fact never explicitly calculated. VEM possesses features that make it superior to the conventional FEM for some special problems such as the problems with complex geometries for which a good quality mesh is difficult to obtain, solutions that require very local refinements, and among others. In these special cases, VEM demonstrates robustness and accuracy in numerical calculations, when the mesh is distorted.

As early as 1957, R. Clough introduced the first graduate finite element course in UC-Berkeley, and since then finite element courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels have been added into engineering higher education curriculums in all the major engineering schools and Universities all over the world. As JT Oden recalled in his 1963 paper, "I went on to return to academia in 1964 and among my first chores was to develop a graduate course on finite element methods. At the same time, I taught mathematics and continuum mechanics, and it became clear to me that finite elements and digital computing offered hope of transforming nonlinear continuum mechanics from a qualitative and academic subject into something useful in modern scientific computing and engineering."

By the end of 2015, there have been more than several hundred of finite element methods monographs and textbooks published in dozens of languages worldwide. An exposition of finite element mathematical theory by Strang and Fix [1972] was among the earliest of those FEM books. JT Oden and his collaborators such as JN Reddy and GF Carey wrote a five-volume finite element monographs in late 1970s and early 1980s. Other FEM books such as those by Zienkiewicz and Cheung, or later Zienkiewicz and Taylor; Cook, Malkus, Plesha, and Witt; TJR. Hughes; KJ. Bathe, and the Nonlinear FEM monographs by Belytschko, Liu, and Moran (1999) and by De Borst, Crisfield, Remmers, and Verhoosel (2012), among others, all have made major impacts on FEM educations and applications. Among all these FEM monographs and textbooks, the book by Zienkiewicz and Taylor or Zienkiewicz, Taylor, and Zhu probably has had most impacts on FEM technology popularization, which may be because R. L. Taylor wrote a FEM research computer program code named FEAP, which was placed in the appendix of that book, providing an immediate guidance on hands-on experience of implementing FEM for the readers.

The development of finite element software technology started in the 1960s. In 1963, E.L. Wilson and R. Clough developed a structural mechanics FEM code called Symbolic Matrix Interpretive System, SMIS, and then Wilson initiated and developed a general-purpose static and dynamic Structural Analysis Program, SAP. In late 1960s and the early 1970s, KJ. Bathe developed nonlinear FEM code ADINA based on SAP IV and NONSAP. Today, the brand name SAP2000 has become synonymous with the state-of-the-art finite element structural analysis and design methods since its introduction over 55 years ago. At the same period, NASA developed its own FEM code called NASTRAN. About the same time in late 1960s, J. Swanson asked his employer Westinghouse to develop FEM computer code, and his suggestion was rejected, and then he left the company and developed the initial ANSYS FEM code. Several years later, J.O. Hallquist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory also developed a 3D nonlinear FEM code called DYNA3D, which later evolved to LS-DYNA. By the end of 1990s and early 2000s, and FEM software industry has become a multi-billion-dollar business. There were several household finite element software company names such as ANSYS, ABAQUS, ADINA, LS-DYNA, NASTRAN, COMSOL Multiphysics, CSI, among others. Today, there are also a plethora of open-source FEM software available online, such as FreeFEM, OpenSees, Elmer, FEBio, FEniCS Project, DUNE, among some others.

## الثالث. (1992-2017) التطبيقات الصناعية الواسعة ونمذجة المواد

كان الحدث الرئيسي الأول في تطوير FEM في هذه الفترة هو صياغة مقدّر خطأ زينكيفيتش-تشو [1992]، والذي كان مساهمة كبيرة في نظرية التقريب الرياضي لطرق العناصر المحدودة في التسعينيات. توفر مقدّرات الخطأ اللاحقة لزينكيفيتش-تشو التحكم في جودة حل العناصر المحدودة مع الاستخدام الأمثل للموارد الحسابية من خلال تنقيح الشبكة بشكل تكيفي. تم تنفيذ فكرة وروح زينكيفيتش-تشو بشكل أكبر من قبل أينسورث وأودين [1997] [2000]، واليوم تم رفع استخدام تقدير الخطأ اللاحق لتحسين الجودة إلى مستوى الاستدلال البايزي والتحديث البايزي. يرتبط موضوع البحث هذا الآن بشكل وثيق بما يُسمى الآن إجراء التحقق والتصديق (V&V).

منذ أواخر السبعينيات، بدأ سزابو [1978] وبابوسكا [1981،1982] في تطوير نسخة hp من FEM بناءً على تقريبات متعددة الحدود متقطعة تستخدم عناصر ذات حجم متغير (h) ودرجة متعددة الحدود (p). اكتشفوا أن طريقة العناصر المحدودة تتقارب بشكل أسي عندما يتم تنقيح الشبكة باستخدام مزيج مناسب من تنقيحات h (تقسيم العناصر إلى عناصر أصغر) وتنقيحات p (زيادة درجتها متعددة الحدود). يجعل التقارب الأسي الطريقة خياراً جذاباً جداً مقارنة بمعظم طرق العناصر المحدودة الأخرى، والتي تتقارب فقط بمعدل جبري. استمر هذا العمل حتى أواخر التسعينيات، بقيادة م. أينسورث، ول. ديمكوفيتش، وجي. تي. أودين، وسي. إيه. إم. دوارتي، وأو. سي. زينكيفيتش، وسي. إي. باومان (انظر ديمكوفيتش وآخرون (1989) أودين وآخرون (1989)). اقترح ج. فيش [1992] أيضاً نسخة s من FEM من خلال تراكب شبكة (شبكات) إضافية من عناصر هرمية ذات ترتيب أعلى فوق الشبكة الأصلية من تفتيت FEM C0، بحيث يزيد من دقة حل FEM.

لحل مشاكل فشل المواد والهياكل، ركز العمل البحثي في التسعينيات على الطرق المفتّتة القائمة على المبدأ التغايري لحل مشاكل ميكانيكا الكسر أو مشاكل توطين الإجهاد. في عام 1994، طور شو ونيدلمان نموذج منطقة متماسكة للعناصر المحدودة (CZM) الذي يمكنه محاكاة نمو الشروخ دون إعادة التشبيك، والذي تم تحسينه لاحقاً من قبل م. أورتيز وزملائه، الذين استخدموا طريقة العناصر المحدودة CZM لحل مشاكل التشظي وإجهاد المواد. تجدر الإشارة إلى أنه قبل فترة طويلة من اختراع نموذج المنطقة المتماسكة، طور س. تي. بيتروشتشاك وز. مروز (1981) أول عنصر محدود متماسك لكسر القص في التربة. لاحقاً، طورت مجموعة بازانت في جامعة نورث ويسترن طرق عناصر محدودة للواجهة المتنوعة، مثل نموذج المستوى الدقيق، لدراسة تأثيرات الحجم لمواد الخرسانة والمواد المركبة الأخرى (بروكا وبازانت (2001)؛ كانر وبازانت (2009)). أصبحت هذه النماذج أداة قياسية لمحاكاة تأثير الصواريخ والانفجارات في، على سبيل المثال، ERDA Vicksburg. تم تطوير نموذج FE للمستوى الدقيق للمركبات الليفية لشركة كرايسلر وفورد لمقارنة تصميمات متنوعة لعلب سحق السيارات (سميلاور وآخرون (2011)). تم صياغة نموذج مستوى دقيق مسامي لامتماثل واستخدامه لتحليل FE للتكسير الهيدروليكي (رحيمي وآخرون (2019)).

لتخفيف مشاكل تحيز الشبكة في نمذجة مشاكل كسر وتلف المواد، طور ت. بيليتشكو وو. ك. ليو طرق الجسيمات الخالية من الشبكة، وهي طريقة جالركين الخالية من العناصر (EFG) وطريقة جسيمات النواة المتكاثرة (RKPM)، والتي تستند إلى طريقة المربعات الصغرى المتحركة وتحليل الموجيات الدقيقة متعدد الدقة، على التوالي. توفر RKPM الاتساق وبالتالي تحسينات التقارب مقارنة بطريقة ديناميكا الجسيمات الملساء (SPH) الشائعة. استخدم س. لي [1999] وآخرون بنجاح طرق جالركين الخالية من الشبكة لمحاكاة تشكيل وانتشار نطاق القص الأديباتي بدقة مع الحد الأدنى من تكيف الشبكة. في نفس الوقت، طور س. إيه. دوارتي وت. أودين ما يسمى بطريقة hp-Cloud؛ وطور إ. أوناتي، وس. إيدلسون، وأو. سي. زينكيفيتش، وآر. إل. تايلور طريقة النقطة المحدودة [1996]، واقترح إس. إن. أتلوري وت. تشو [1998] طريقة بتروف-جالركين المحلية الخالية من الشبكة (MLPG)، من بين العديد من الطرق الأخرى الخالية من الشبكة. أظهر فليمنج وبيليتشكو أيضاً أنه يمكن تضمين دوال التفرد في دوال التقريب لتحسين المحاكاة بشكل كبير التي تتضمن ميكانيكا الكسر (فليمنج وآخرون (1997)).

واحدة من أكثر المشاكل تحدياً في تطوير طريقة جالركين الخالية من الشبكة هي كيفية تكامل الصيغة الضعيفة، لأن دوال الاستيفاء الخالية من الشبكة غير منتظمة للغاية ومن الصعب جعلها متسقة تغايرياً. في عام 2001، اقترح ج. س. تشين وزملاؤه طريقة تكامل عقدية متطابقة مستقرة لطريقة RKPM الخالية من الشبكة، والتي ليست فقط بسيطة ومستقرة، ولكنها أيضاً متسقة تغايرياً مع صياغة جالركين الضعيفة (تشين وآخرون (2001)).

بعد فترة وجيزة من تطورات الطريقة الخالية من الشبكة، طور آي. بابوسكا وزملاؤه طريقة العناصر المحدودة لتقسيم الوحدة (PUFEM)، والتي سُميت لاحقاً طريقة العناصر المحدودة المعممة (GFEM) (انظر ميلينك وبابوسكا (1996) وبابوسكا وميلينك (1997)). PUFEM طريقة قوية لأنه يمكن استخدامها لبناء فضاءات FE من أي انتظام معين، وهو تعميم لنسخ h و p و hp من طريقة العناصر المحدودة، بالإضافة إلى توفير القدرة على تضمين حل تحليلي في تفتيت FEM بدلاً من الاعتماد على دالة استيفاء متعددة الحدود عامة.

جاء اختراق كبير في ميكانيكا الكسر الحسابية وتقنية تنقيح العناصر المحدودة في أواخر التسعينيات، عندما طور تيد بيليتشكو وزملاؤه، بما في ذلك ت. بلاك، ون. مويس، وج. دولبو، العنصر المحدود الممتد (X-FEM) (انظر بيليتشكو وبلاك (1999)، ومويس وآخرون (1999))، الذي يستخدم دوال شكل منفصلة معززة متنوعة لالتقاط مورفولوجيا جسم متشقق بدقة دون إعادة التشبيك. لأن عملية الإثراء التكيفية تُحكم بمعدل إطلاق الطاقة عند طرف الشرخ، توفر X-FEM حلاً دقيقاً لميكانيكا الكسر المرن الخطي (LEFM). في اختراع X-FEM، استخدم تيد بيليتشكو ببراعة مفهوم PUFEM في حل مشاكل ميكانيكا الكسر دون إعادة التشبيك.

عند دخول الألفية الجديدة، اقترح أ. كارما وزملاؤه (كارما وآخرون [2000]) طريقة العناصر المحدودة لحقل الطور لحل مشاكل نمو الشروخ وانتشارها، حيث يمكن لطريقة حقل الطور التنبؤ بدقة بتلف المواد للكسر الهش. بعض المساهمين الرائدين في موضوع البحث هذا هم ب. بوردين، وتي جي آر. هيوز، وس. كون، وآر. مولر، وس. ميهي، وسي. إم. لانديس، من بين آخرين.

كما ذُكر من قبل، السبب الرئيسي للنجاح الهائل لطرق العناصر المحدودة هو قابليتها الواسعة للتطبيق على التحليل والتصميم الهندسي عبر التخصصات العلمية. من ناحية أخرى، يتم إجراء معظم التصاميم الهندسية الميكانيكية باستخدام أدوات التصميم بمساعدة الحاسوب (CAD) المختلفة، مثل النمذجة الصلبة. لمزج طريقة العناصر المحدودة مباشرة في أدوات تصميم CAD، طور تي جي آر. هيوز وزملاؤه مثل جي. إيه. كوتريل وواي. بازيليفز (هيوز وآخرون (2005)، كوتريل وآخرون (2009)) طريقة التحليل الهندسي المتساوي (IGA) للعناصر المحدودة، التي أنشأت صياغة جالركين التغايرية الضعيفة في شبكة التحكم وتستخدم دوال شرائح الأساس النسبي غير المنتظم (NURBS) كدالة شكل FEM لحل المشكلة في مرحلة التصميم.

بسبب ظهور تقنية النانو، تم تطوير طرق متعددة المقاييس متنوعة لربط الطرق الذرية مثل الديناميكا الجزيئية ونظرية الكثافة الوظيفية (DFT) وطرق ab initio الأخرى مع طرق العناصر المحدودة على مقياس المتصل. المساهمات الأبرز في هذا المجال هي طريقة المصافحة (ف. ف. إبراهام، ج. ك. بروتون، ن. بيرنشتاين، وإ. كاكسيراس (1998))، طريقة العناصر المحدودة شبه المتصلة (إ. ب. تادمور، م. أورتيز، ر. فيليبس (1996))، وطريقة مقياس الجسر التي طورها ج. فاجنر وو. ك. ليو (2003)، وهو استخدام بارع للشكلية موري-زوانزيج في تقنية الربط متعدد المقاييس. في عام 2007، طور ف. جافيني، وك. بهاتاشاريا، وم. أورتيز صياغة العناصر المحدودة لنظرية الكثافة الوظيفية (DFT) الخالية من المدارات شبه المتصلة لحسابات DFT متعددة الملايين من الذرات (جافيني وآخرون (2007)).

بالمثل، كان هناك تطور سريع في طرق التجانس الحسابية منذ أواخر التسعينيات، وهو مقاربة بديلة للحصول على خصائص مقياس المتصل بناءً على البنى الدقيقة ذات المقياس الأصغر. يمكن تقسيم طريقة التجانس الحسابية أو طرق التجانس للعناصر المحدودة للمواد المركبة إلى فئتين رئيسيتين: (1) طريقة التجانس المقاربة الحسابية أو التجانس الحسابي متعدد المقاييس، والذي يهدف إلى نمذجة المواد المركبة ذات البنية الدقيقة الدورية. يمكن نسب الرائد في طريقة العناصر المحدودة للتجانس متعدد المقاييس إلى تي واي هو وزملائه (1997)، والمساهمون الأوائل الآخرون هم ن. كيكوتشي، وس. غوش، وج. فيش وم. س. شيبارد؛ و (2) طريقة الميكانيكا الدقيقة الحسابية، والتي تهدف بشكل رئيسي إلى المواد المركبة ذات البنية الدقيقة العشوائية، على الرغم من أنها قد تُطبق أيضاً على المواد ذات البنية الدقيقة الدورية، حيث المساهمون الرئيسيون هم: ب. سوكيه وزملاؤه في المركز الوطني الفرنسي للبحث العلمي (CNRS)، وج. ج. دفوراك (1994) وج. فيش في معهد رينسيلير البوليتكنيك وس. ميهي (1999) ومجموعته في جامعة شتوتغارت. خلال نفس الفترة، تم تطوير العديد من حلالات التفاعل بين الموائع والهياكل FEM الجديدة، على سبيل المثال، طريقة العناصر المحدودة المغمورة التي طورتها ل. تشانغ وزملاؤها (2004)، والتي كانت مستوحاة من طريقة الحدود المغمورة التي رائدها س. بيسكين من معهد كورانت للعلوم الرياضية، جامعة نيويورك.

ظهر مجال تطبيق مهم للعناصر المحدودة مع تطورات المرونة الحسابية. تستند صياغة المرونة الحسابية للعناصر المحدودة المبكرة إلى صياغة معدل المرونة الهيبوإلاستية. لإرضاء متطلب الموضوعية، اقترح تي جي آر هيوز وج. وينجت لأول مرة ما يسمى بالموضوعية الزيادية (1980)، وهي المرة الأولى التي طُبقت فيها نظرية ميكانيكا المتصلات الباطنية على صياغات وحسابات العناصر المحدودة، وبدورها عززت تطوير ميكانيكا المتصلات غير الخطية في الثمانينيات والتسعينيات. بعد ذلك بفترة وجيزة. ثم مدد سيمو وهيوز خوارزمية الموضوعية الزيادية لهيوز-وينجت إلى حالة التشوه المحدود في المرونة الحسابية. تم تقديم مفهوم الاتساق بين مصفوفة الصلابة المماسة وخوارزمية التكامل المستخدمة في حل المشكلة الزيادية من قبل ناجتيجال (1982) وسيمو وتايلور (1985). تم تطوير صياغات متسقة لاحقاً لمرونة التشوه المحدود من قبل سيمو وأورتيز (1985،1988) ضمن إطار التحلل الضربي لتدرج التشوه والمرونة الفائقة. أيضاً في الثمانينيات، بناءً على نموذج جورسون، طور تفيرجارد ونيدلمان (1984) نموذج جورسون-تفيرجارد-نيدلمان القائم على العناصر المحدودة، وهو على الأرجح نموذج التكوين الأكثر استخداماً للمرونة الحسابية للعناصر المحدودة المستخدم في نمذجة المواد، على الرغم من أن الاهتمام تحول مؤخراً إلى تطوير نماذج المرونة الحسابية القائمة على التعلم الآلي أو المدفوعة بالبيانات، على سبيل المثال، إ. تشينيستا، وآخرون (2017)، وطرق العناصر المحدودة المدفوعة بالبيانات للتعلم الآلي غير الخاضع للإشراف، تسمى التحليل العنقودي ذاتي الاتساق (SCA)، من قبل ز. ليو وآخرون (2016، 2018).

تقدم مهم لطريقة العناصر المحدودة هو تطوير طريقة العناصر المحدودة لمرونة البلورات (CPFEM)، والتي تم تقديمها لأول مرة في ورقة بارزة من قبل د. بيرس، وآر. ج. أسارو، وأ. نيدلمان في عام 1982. في العقود الأربعة الماضية تقريباً، هناك عدد من الأشخاص الذين قدموا مساهمات كبيرة في الموضوع، على سبيل المثال، أ. أرسينليس ود. م. باركس من MIT ومختبر لورنس ليفرمور الوطني (1999،2002،2004)؛ وبي. آر. داوسون وزملاؤه في جامعة كورنيل (1989،2011)، ود. راابي وزملاؤه في معهد ماكس بلانك فور إيسنفورشونج (2003،2004،2006)، من بين آخرين. بناءً على انزلاق البلورات، يمكن لـ CPFEM حساب التفكك، واتجاه البلورات، ومعلومات النسيج الأخرى للنظر في لامتماثل البلورات أثناء الحسابات، وقد تم تطبيقه لمحاكاة تشوه مرونة البلورات، وخشونة السطح، والكسور وما إلى ذلك. مؤخراً، طور س. لي وزملاؤه ديناميكا نمط التفكك متعدد المقاييس القائم على العناصر المحدودة لنمذجة مرونة البلورات في البلورة الواحدة (2019). أعاد يو وآخرون، (2019) صياغة التحليل العنقودي ذاتي الاتساق (SCA) للمواد اللزجة-البلاستيكية المرنة العامة تحت التشوه المحدود. يتم إظهار الدقة والكفاءة للتنبؤ بالاستجابة الميكانيكية الكلية للمواد متعددة البلورات من خلال المقارنة مع طرق العناصر المحدودة التقليدية للحقل الكامل.

في عام 2013، اقترحت مجموعة من العلماء والمهندسين الإيطاليين بقيادة ل. بييراو دا فييجا وف. بريزي ما يسمى بطريقة العنصر الافتراضي (VEM). طريقة العنصر الافتراضي هي امتداد لطريقة العناصر المحدودة التقليدية لهندسيات العناصر التعسفية. إنها تسمح بالتفتيتات متعددة الأضلاع (المضلعات في 2-D أو متعددات السطوح في 3-D)، والتي قد تكون حتى نطاقات عناصر غير منتظمة للغاية وغير محدبة. يشتق الاسم "افتراضي" من حقيقة أن معرفة أساس دالة الشكل المحلي غير مطلوبة، وفي الواقع لا يتم حسابها بشكل صريح أبداً. تمتلك VEM ميزات تجعلها متفوقة على FEM التقليدية لبعض المشاكل الخاصة مثل المشاكل ذات الهندسيات المعقدة التي يصعب الحصول فيها على شبكة ذات جودة جيدة، والحلول التي تتطلب تنقيحات محلية جداً، من بين أمور أخرى. في هذه الحالات الخاصة، تُظهر VEM المتانة والدقة في الحسابات العددية، عندما تكون الشبكة مشوهة.

في وقت مبكر من عام 1957، قدم ر. كلاف أول دورة دراسات عليا للعناصر المحدودة في جامعة كاليفورنيا-بيركلي، ومنذ ذلك الحين تم إضافة دورات العناصر المحدودة على مستويات الدراسات العليا والجامعية إلى مناهج التعليم العالي الهندسي في جميع كليات ومعاهد الهندسة الرئيسية في جميع أنحاء العالم. كما تذكر جي تي أودين في ورقته البحثية عام 1963، "واصلت العودة إلى الأكاديمية في عام 1964 وكان من بين مهامي الأولى تطوير دورة دراسات عليا حول طرق العناصر المحدودة. في نفس الوقت، قمت بتدريس الرياضيات وميكانيكا المتصلات، وأصبح واضحاً لي أن العناصر المحدودة والحوسبة الرقمية قدمت أملاً في تحويل ميكانيكا المتصلات غير الخطية من موضوع نوعي وأكاديمي إلى شيء مفيد في الحوسبة العلمية والهندسة الحديثة."

بحلول نهاية عام 2015، تم نشر أكثر من عدة مئات من مونوجرافات وكتب طرق العناصر المحدودة في عشرات اللغات في جميع أنحاء العالم. كان عرض النظرية الرياضية للعناصر المحدودة من قبل سترانج وفيكس [1972] من بين أقدم كتب FEM تلك. كتب جي تي أودين ومتعاونوه مثل جي. إن. ريدي وجي. إف. كاري مونوجرافات العناصر المحدودة من خمسة مجلدات في أواخر السبعينيات وأوائل الثمانينيات. كتب FEM الأخرى مثل تلك التي كتبها زينكيفيتش وتشيونج، أو لاحقاً زينكيفيتش وتايلور؛ وكوك، ومالكوس، وبليشا، ويت؛ وتي جي آر. هيوز؛ وك. ج. باتي، ومونوجرافات FEM غير الخطية من قبل بيليتشكو، وليو، وموران (1999) ومن قبل دي بورست، وكريسفيلد، وريمرز، وفيرهوسيل (2012)، من بين آخرين، كل منها أحدث تأثيرات كبيرة على تعليم وتطبيقات FEM. من بين كل هذه المونوجرافات والكتب الدراسية لـ FEM، ربما كان للكتاب الذي كتبه زينكيفيتش وتايلور أو زينكيفيتش، وتايلور، وتشو التأثيرات الأكثر على شعبية تقنية FEM، والذي قد يكون لأن آر. ل. تايلور كتب كود برنامج حاسوب أبحاث FEM يسمى FEAP، والذي تم وضعه في ملحق ذلك الكتاب، مما يوفر إرشاداً فورياً على الخبرة العملية لتنفيذ FEM للقراء.

بدأ تطوير تقنية برمجيات العناصر المحدودة في الستينيات. في عام 1963، طور إ. ل. ويلسون وآر. كلاف كود FEM للميكانيكا الإنشائية يسمى نظام المصفوفة الرمزية التفسيري، SMIS، ثم بدأ ويلسون وطور برنامج التحليل الهيكلي الساكن والديناميكي للأغراض العامة، SAP. في أواخر الستينيات وأوائل السبعينيات، طور ك. ج. باتي كود FEM غير الخطي ADINA بناءً على SAP IV وNONSAP. اليوم، أصبح الاسم التجاري SAP2000 مرادفاً لأحدث طرق التحليل والتصميم الهيكلي للعناصر المحدودة منذ تقديمه منذ أكثر من 55 عاماً. في نفس الفترة، طورت ناسا كود FEM الخاص بها يسمى NASTRAN. في نفس الوقت تقريباً في أواخر الستينيات، طلب ج. سوانسون من صاحب عمله ويستنجهاوس تطوير كود حاسوب FEM، ورُفض اقتراحه، ثم غادر الشركة وطور كود ANSYS FEM الأولي. بعد عدة سنوات، طور ج. أو. هالكويست في مختبر لورنس ليفرمور الوطني أيضاً كود FEM غير خطي ثلاثي الأبعاد يسمى DYNA3D، والذي تطور لاحقاً إلى LS-DYNA. بحلول نهاية التسعينيات وأوائل الألفينات، أصبحت صناعة برمجيات FEM عملاً بمليارات الدولارات. كانت هناك عدة أسماء شركات برمجيات العناصر المحدودة المعروفة مثل ANSYS، وABAQUS، وADINA، وLS-DYNA، وNASTRAN، وCOMSOL Multiphysics، وCSI، من بين آخرين. اليوم، هناك أيضاً وفرة من برمجيات FEM مفتوحة المصدر المتاحة عبر الإنترنت، مثل FreeFEM، وOpenSees، وElmer، وFEBio، وFEniCS Project، وDUNE، من بين بعض الآخرين.
