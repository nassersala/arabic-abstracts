## Paper Summary

This is a comprehensive 80-year historical survey of the Finite Element Method (FEM), one of the most important computational methods in engineering and science. The paper traces FEM from its origins in 1941 through four major eras of development, covering its impact on structural mechanics, materials modeling, fluid dynamics, and modern applications in additive manufacturing, biomechanics, and computational design.

## Historical Significance

- **Domain:** Computational Engineering, Numerical Methods, Applied Mathematics
- **Impact:** FEM revolutionized engineering design across aerospace, civil, mechanical, and biomedical engineering
- **Citations:** Foundational work cited by virtually all computational mechanics research
- **Applications:** Automobiles, aircraft, bridges, buildings, medical devices, semiconductor chips, additive manufacturing

## Four Historical Periods

1. **Period I (1941-1965):** Birth of FEM - Hrennikoff, Courant, Clough, Argyris, Turner, Feng Kang
2. **Period II (1966-1991):** Golden Age - Mathematical foundations, convergence theory, mixed methods
3. **Period III (1992-2017):** Industrial Applications - Large-scale simulations, material modeling
4. **Period IV (2018-present):** New Era - Machine learning integration, data-driven methods, multiscale modeling
