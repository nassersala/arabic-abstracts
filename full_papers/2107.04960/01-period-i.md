## I. (1941-1965) The birth of the finite element method

The origin of the finite element method as a numerical modeling paradigm may be traced back to in early 1940's. In 1941, A. Hrennikoff, a Russian-Canadian structural engineer at the University of British Columbia, published a paper in ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics on his membrane and plate model as a lattice framework. This paper is now generally regarded as a turning point that led to the birth of FEM. In Hrennikoff's 1941 paper, he discretized the solution domain into a mesh of lattice structure, which was the earliest form of a mesh discretization.

On May 3rd, 1941, the same year that Hrennikoff published his paper, R. Courant of New York University delivered an invited lecture at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society held in Washington D.C. on his numerical treatment using a variational method to solve a second order PDE, which arises from Saint-Venant's torsion problem of a cylinder. In this work, Courant systematically used the Rayleigh Ritz method with a trial function defined on finite triangle subdomains, which is a primitive form of the finite element method. Courant's presentation was later published as a paper in 1943. Similar works of discretization and variational formulations were also reported in the literature, including McHenry [1943], Prager and Synge [1947], and Synge [1957]. As Ray Clough commented in his 1980 paper, "One aspect of the FEM, mathematical modeling of continua by discrete elements, can be related to work done independently in the 1940s by McHenry and Hrennikoff - formulating bar element assemblages to simulate plane stress systems. Indeed, I spent the summer of 1952 at the Boeing Airplane Company trying to adapt this procedure to the analysis of a delta airplane wing, the problem which eventually led to the FEM."

By the early 1950s, several engineers and academics had further developed and extended these early approaches to solve real engineering problems in aeronautical and civil engineering. In parallel but with different emphases, J. H. Argyris (1954) at the Imperial College London, and M. J. Turner (1950-1956) at Boeing Company, who was later joined by R. Clough of UC Berkeley and H.C. Martin of Washington University, developed what we know today as the earliest form of the finite element method (1954), which was called the Matrix Stiffness Method at the time. However, in 1960 R. Clough coined the phrase "Finite Element Method", and this unassuming and right-to-the-point phrase was an instant hit, bringing out the essence of the method.

Using the language of engineers, Argyris "translated" Courant's variational approach into the energy method of engineering structures, while importantly, Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp developed FEM interpolants for triangular elements, which is suitable for structural parts with arbitrary shape. In some sense, the invention of the triangle element was a "quantum leap", and hence for a large spectrum of the engineering community, the inception of the FEM is the publication of the landmark paper by Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp in 1956. The following is an excerpt from a 2014 document that celebrates the 50th anniversary of the formation of National Academy of Engineering, which is an official account of that part of FEM history:

"To ensure safety and avoid costly modifications after planes entered production, engineers needed a reliable method for determining in advance whether their designs could withstand the stresses of flight. M. Jon Turner, head of Boeing's Structural Dynamics Unit, addressed that problem in the early 1950s by bringing civil engineering professor Ray Clough of the University of California, Berkeley, and Harold Martin of the University of Washington to Boeing for summer 'faculty internships.' Collectively, they created a method of structural analysis that Turner applied at Boeing using computers to perform the myriad calculations needed to predict real-world performance. That fruitful collaboration led to Clough's development a few years later of what he named the finite element method (FEM). Clough formed a research group at UC Berkeley that used FEM in a host of analytical and experimental activities, from designing buildings and structures to withstand nuclear blasts or earthquakes to analyzing structural requirements for spacecraft and deep-water offshore drilling. By revolutionizing the application of computer technologies in engineering, FEM continues to help engineers design to this day all sorts of durable, cost-effective structures. Meanwhile, Turner's efforts at Boeing contributed to the success of its renowned line of commercial jets, beginning in 1958 with the 707 and continuing in 1964 with the 727, which could land on shorter runways and serve more airports. Equipped with three fuel-efficient turbofan engines, the 727 became the workhorse of commercial aviation and helped achieve a threefold increase in U.S. passenger air traffic in the '60s."

Independently and separately, in the early 1960s, Kang Feng of the Chinese Academy of Science also proposed a discretization numerical method based on variational principles for solving elliptic partial differential equations. As Peter Lax (1993) commented, "Independently of parallel developments in the West, he (Feng) created a theory of the finite element method. He was instrumental in both the implementation of the method and the creation of its theoretical foundation using estimates in Sobolev spaces....", which was one of the first convergence studies of finite element methods.

During this period, several great engineering minds were focusing on developing finite element methods. In particular, J. Argyris with his co-workers at the University of Stuttgart; R. Clough and colleagues such as E. L. Wilson and R. L. Taylor at the University of California, Berkeley; O. Zienkiewicz with his colleagues such as E. Hinton and B. Irons at Swansea University; P. Ciarlet at the University of Paris XI; R. Gallager and his group at Cornell University, R. Melosh at Philco Corporation, and B. Fraeijs de Veubeke at the University de Liege had made some important and significant contributions to developments of finite element methods.

To understand what happened sixty years ago, we quote an excerpt from a FEM history paper by Clough and Wilson in 1999, in which they recalled: "When Clough presented the first paper using the finite element terminology in 1960 it attracted the attention of his friend, Professor O. C. Zienkiewicz, who was then on the faculty at Northwestern University. A few weeks after the presentation of the paper Zienkiewicz invited Clough to present a seminar on the finite element method to his students. Zienkiewicz was considered one of the world's experts on the application of the finite difference method to the solution of continuum mechanics problems in Civil Engineering; therefore, Clough was prepared to debate the relative merits of the two methods. However, after a few penetrating questions about the finite element method, Zienkiewicz was almost an instant convert to the method."

Zdenek Bazant, then a visiting Associate Research Engineer at UC Berkeley, recalled: "...The founding of FEM was Clough's 1960 paper in the ASCE Conf. on Electronic Computation (Clough (1960)), which was the first to derive, by virtual work, the finite element stiffness matrix of an element of a continuum (a triangular constant strain element).... I recall Ray Clough showing to me his 1962 report to the U.S. Engineer District, Little Rock, Corps of Engineers on his analysis of a crack observed in Norfolk Dam (Clough (1962)), during my stay in Berkeley in 1969. I was mesmerized by seeing that 1962 report. It presented a 2D stress analysis of large crack observed in Norfork dam. The dam was subdivided into about 200 triangular elements and provided stress contours for a number of loading cases.... Clough was at that time way ahead of anybody else."

To corroborate Z. Bazant's recollection, we cite Ed Wilson's recount of that part of the history: "In 1956, Ray, Shirley, and three small children spent a year in Norway at the Ship Research Institute in Trondheim. The engineers at the institute were calculating stresses due to ship vibrations in order to predict fatigue failures at the stress concentrations. This is when Ray realized his element research should be called the Finite Element Method which could solve many different types of problems in continuum mechanics. Ray realized the FEM was a direct competitor to the Finite Difference Method. At that time FDM was being used to solve many problems in continuum mechanics. His previous work at Boeing, the Direct Stiffness Method, was only used to calculate displacements not stresses.

In the fall semester of 1957, Ray returned from his sabbatical leave in Norway and immediately posted a page on the student bulletin board asking students to contact him if they were interested in conducting finite element research for the analysis of membrane, plate, shell, and solid structures. Although Ray did not have funding for finite element research, a few graduate students who had other sources of funds responded. At that time, the only digital computer in the College of Engineering was an IBM 701 that was produced in 1951 and was based on vacuum tube technology. The maximum number of linear equations that it could solve was 40. Consequently, when Ray presented his first FEM paper in September 1960, 'The Finite Element Method in Plane Stress Analysis,' at the ASCE 2nd Conference on Electronic Computation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the coarse-mesh stress-distribution obtained was not very accurate. Therefore, most of the attendees at the conference were not impressed. After the improvement of the speed and capacity of the computers on the Berkeley campus, Professor Clough's paper was a very fine mesh analysis of an existing concrete dam. The paper was first presented in September 1962 at a NATO conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Within a few months, the paper was republished in an international Bulletin, which had a very large circulation, as 'Stress Analysis of a Gravity Dam by the Finite Element Method', (with E. Wilson), International Bulletin RILEM, No. 10, June 1963."

The Lisbon paper reported on the finite element analysis of the 250-foot-high Norfork Dam in Arkansas, which had developed a vertical crack during construction in 1942. The FEM analysis correctly predicted the location and size of the crack due to the temperature changes and produced realistic displacements and stresses within the dam and foundation for both gravity and several hydrostatic load conditions. Because of this publication, many international students and visiting scholars came to Berkeley to work with Professor Clough. Also, he freely gave the FORTRAN listing of their finite element analysis computer program to be used to evaluate displacement and stresses in other two-dimensional plane structures with different geometry, materials and loading. Therefore, professional engineers could easily use the powerful new FEM to solve for the stress distributions in their structural engineering problems in continuum mechanics. However, he did not capitalize on his success in the development of the FEM. He returned to the task of building the earthquake engineering program at Berkeley – the task he was given when he was first hired in 1949.

For his decisive contribution to the developments of FEM, Ray William Clough was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1994 by the then vice-president of the United States Al Gore. Today, the general consensus is that Ray Clough along with J. Argyris and O. C. Zienkiewicz made the most significant contributions to the developments of finite element method after an early mathematical pre-working of Richard Courant.

It is worth noting that E. L. Wilson of UC Berkeley was the first person to develop finite element open-source software. An excerpt from the Clough and Wilson's paper in 1999 stated: "In 1958 Wilson, under the direction of Clough, initiated the development of an automated finite element program based on the rectangular plane stress finite element developed at Boeing. After several months of learning to program the IBM 701, Wilson produced a limited capacity, semiautomated program which was based on the force method. An MS research report was produced, which has long since been misplaced, with the approximate title of Computer Analysis of Plane Stress Structures.... In 1959 the IBM 704 computer was installed on the Berkeley Campus. It had 32K of 32 bit memory and a floating point arithmetic unit which was approximately 100 times faster than the IBM 701. This made it possible to solve practical structures using fine meshes."

It is also worth mentioning that in 1963, I.T. Oden, a senior structural engineering in the research and development division of General Dynamics Corporation at Fort Worth at the time, wrote a 163-page comprehensive technical report with G.C. Best, in which they developed a long list of solid and structure finite elements, including tetrahedral element, hexahedral element, thin plate element, thick plate element, plate element with stringers or stiffeners, composite sandwich plate elements, and shallow shell elements (Best and Oden (1963)). In fact, Oden and Best wrote one of the first general purpose finite element computer codes at the time. The Fortran FEM code developed by Oden and Best had an element library that includes elements for 3D elasticity, 2D plane elasticity, 3D beam and rod elements, composite layered plate and shell elements, and elements for general composite materials. Their work also included hybrid methods and stress-based FEMs, which may be even earlier than those of Pian (Pian (1964)). Moreover, Oden and Best's FEM code is also able to handle FEM eigenvalue modal analysis, and numerical integrations over triangle and tetrahedra elements, and it had linear system solvers for general FEM static analysis that were among the most effective at that time. This FEM computer code was used for many years in aircraft analysis and design in the aerospace and defense industry.

In terms of worldwide research interest, by 1965, finite element research had become a highly active field, with the total number of papers published in the literature exceeding 1000. During this period, there were two seemingly unrelated events for FEM development, but significantly affected future FEM developments. These events were the discovery of mixed variational principles in elasticity. In 1950, E. Reissner rediscovered E. Hellinger's mixed variational principle from 1914, in which both the displacement field and the stress field are the primary unknowns. This variational principle is called the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle. Shortly after, H. Hu in 1954 and K. Washizu in 1955 proposed a three-field mixed variational principle in elasticity, which was called the Hu-Washizu variational principle. As early as 1964, Theodore H.H. Pian recognized the potential of using these variational principles to formulate Galerkin weak form-based finite element formulations and proposed the assumed stress finite element method. This began the use of mixed variational principles to formulate Galerkin finite element methods, which was followed by the assumed strain finite element method developed by Juan Simo and his co-workers in the later period of finite element developments.

## الأول. (1941-1965) ميلاد طريقة العناصر المحدودة

يمكن تتبع أصل طريقة العناصر المحدودة كنموذج للنمذجة العددية إلى أوائل الأربعينيات. في عام 1941، نشر أ. هرينيكوف، وهو مهندس إنشائي روسي-كندي في جامعة كولومبيا البريطانية، ورقة بحثية في مجلة ASME للميكانيكا التطبيقية عن نموذجه للأغشية والألواح كإطار شبكي. تُعتبر هذه الورقة الآن بشكل عام نقطة تحول أدت إلى ميلاد FEM. في ورقة هرينيكوف عام 1941، قام بتفتيت مجال الحل إلى شبكة من بنية شبكية، وهو أقدم شكل من أشكال تفتيت الشبكة.

في 3 مايو 1941، نفس العام الذي نشر فيه هرينيكوف ورقته، ألقى ر. كورانت من جامعة نيويورك محاضرة بدعوة في اجتماع للجمعية الأمريكية للرياضيات عُقد في واشنطن العاصمة حول معالجته العددية باستخدام طريقة تغايرية لحل معادلة تفاضلية جزئية من الدرجة الثانية، والتي تنشأ من مسألة الالتواء لسانت-فينانت للأسطوانة. في هذا العمل، استخدم كورانت بشكل منهجي طريقة رايلي-ريتز مع دالة تجريبية معرّفة على نطاقات فرعية مثلثية محدودة، وهو شكل بدائي من طريقة العناصر المحدودة. نُشرت محاضرة كورانت لاحقاً كورقة بحثية في عام 1943. تم الإبلاغ أيضاً عن أعمال مماثلة للتفتيت والصياغات التغايرية في الأدبيات، بما في ذلك ماكهنري [1943]، وبراجر وسينج [1947]، وسينج [1957]. كما علق راي كلاف في ورقته البحثية عام 1980، "يمكن ربط أحد جوانب FEM، وهو النمذجة الرياضية للمتصلات بواسطة عناصر منفصلة، بالعمل الذي تم بشكل مستقل في الأربعينيات من قبل ماكهنري وهرينيكوف - صياغة تجميعات عناصر القضبان لمحاكاة أنظمة الإجهاد المستوي. في الواقع، قضيت صيف عام 1952 في شركة بوينج للطائرات محاولاً تكييف هذا الإجراء لتحليل جناح طائرة دلتا، المشكلة التي أدت في النهاية إلى FEM."

بحلول أوائل الخمسينيات، قام العديد من المهندسين والأكاديميين بتطوير وتوسيع هذه المقاربات المبكرة لحل مشاكل هندسية حقيقية في الهندسة الجوية والمدنية. بشكل متوازٍ ولكن مع تركيزات مختلفة، طور ج. ه. أرجيريس (1954) في كلية لندن الإمبراطورية، وم. ج. تيرنر (1950-1956) في شركة بوينج، الذي انضم إليه لاحقاً ر. كلاف من جامعة كاليفورنيا في بيركلي وه.س. مارتن من جامعة واشنطن، ما نعرفه اليوم بأقدم شكل من أشكال طريقة العناصر المحدودة (1954)، والتي كانت تسمى في ذلك الوقت طريقة مصفوفة الصلابة. ومع ذلك، في عام 1960 صاغ ر. كلاف عبارة "طريقة العناصر المحدودة"، وكانت هذه العبارة البسيطة والمباشرة نجاحاً فورياً، حيث أبرزت جوهر الطريقة.

باستخدام لغة المهندسين، "ترجم" أرجيريس المقاربة التغايرية لكورانت إلى طريقة الطاقة للهياكل الهندسية، بينما الأهم من ذلك، طور تيرنر وكلاف ومارتن وتوب دوال استيفاء FEM للعناصر المثلثية، والتي تناسب الأجزاء الإنشائية ذات الشكل التعسفي. بمعنى ما، كان اختراع العنصر المثلثي "قفزة كمية"، وبالتالي بالنسبة لطيف كبير من المجتمع الهندسي، فإن بداية FEM هي نشر الورقة البحثية البارزة من قبل تيرنر وكلاف ومارتن وتوب في عام 1956. فيما يلي مقتطف من وثيقة عام 2014 التي تحتفل بالذكرى الخمسين لتشكيل الأكاديمية الوطنية للهندسة، وهي سرد رسمي لذلك الجزء من تاريخ FEM:

"لضمان السلامة وتجنب التعديلات المكلفة بعد دخول الطائرات الإنتاج، احتاج المهندسون إلى طريقة موثوقة لتحديد مسبقاً ما إذا كانت تصميماتهم يمكن أن تتحمل ضغوط الطيران. عالج م. جون تيرنر، رئيس وحدة الديناميكا الهيكلية في بوينج، تلك المشكلة في أوائل الخمسينيات من خلال جلب أستاذ الهندسة المدنية راي كلاف من جامعة كاليفورنيا، بيركلي، وهارولد مارتن من جامعة واشنطن إلى بوينج لـ 'تدريبات صيفية لأعضاء هيئة التدريس'. معاً، ابتكروا طريقة للتحليل الإنشائي طبقها تيرنر في بوينج باستخدام الحواسيب لإجراء العديد من الحسابات اللازمة للتنبؤ بالأداء في العالم الحقيقي. أدى ذلك التعاون المثمر إلى تطوير كلاف بعد بضع سنوات لما أسماه طريقة العناصر المحدودة (FEM). شكّل كلاف مجموعة بحثية في جامعة كاليفورنيا بيركلي استخدمت FEM في مجموعة من الأنشطة التحليلية والتجريبية، من تصميم المباني والهياكل لتحمل الانفجارات النووية أو الزلازل إلى تحليل المتطلبات الهيكلية للمركبات الفضائية والحفر البحري في المياه العميقة. من خلال إحداث ثورة في تطبيق تقنيات الحاسوب في الهندسة، تستمر FEM في مساعدة المهندسين على تصميم جميع أنواع الهياكل المتينة والفعالة من حيث التكلفة حتى يومنا هذا. في الوقت نفسه، ساهمت جهود تيرنر في بوينج في نجاح خطها الشهير من الطائرات النفاثة التجارية، بدءاً من عام 1958 مع 707 واستمراراً في عام 1964 مع 727، التي يمكن أن تهبط على مدارج أقصر وتخدم المزيد من المطارات. مجهزة بثلاثة محركات توربينية موفرة للوقود، أصبحت 727 حصان العمل للطيران التجاري وساعدت في تحقيق زيادة ثلاثة أضعاف في حركة ركاب الطيران الأمريكية في الستينيات."

بشكل مستقل ومنفصل، في أوائل الستينيات، اقترح كانغ فينغ من الأكاديمية الصينية للعلوم أيضاً طريقة عددية للتفتيت بناءً على المبادئ التغايرية لحل المعادلات التفاضلية الجزئية الإهليلجية. كما علق بيتر لاكس (1993)، "بشكل مستقل عن التطورات الموازية في الغرب، أنشأ (فينغ) نظرية لطريقة العناصر المحدودة. كان له دور أساسي في كل من تنفيذ الطريقة وإنشاء أساسها النظري باستخدام التقديرات في فضاءات سوبوليف...."، وهو أحد أولى دراسات التقارب لطرق العناصر المحدودة.

خلال هذه الفترة، كان العديد من العقول الهندسية العظيمة تركز على تطوير طرق العناصر المحدودة. على وجه الخصوص، ج. أرجيريس مع زملائه في جامعة شتوتغارت؛ ر. كلاف وزملاء مثل إ. ل. ويلسون وآر. ل. تايلور في جامعة كاليفورنيا، بيركلي؛ أو. زينكيفيتش مع زملائه مثل إ. هينتون وب. آيرونز في جامعة سوانزي؛ ب. سيارليه في جامعة باريس الحادية عشرة؛ ر. غالاغر ومجموعته في جامعة كورنيل، ر. ميلوش في شركة فيلكو، وب. فرايجيس دي فيوبيكي في جامعة لييج، قدموا بعض المساهمات المهمة والكبيرة في تطوير طرق العناصر المحدودة.

لفهم ما حدث قبل ستين عاماً، نقتبس مقتطفاً من ورقة بحثية حول تاريخ FEM لكلاف وويلسون في عام 1999، حيث تذكرا: "عندما قدم كلاف الورقة الأولى باستخدام مصطلح العناصر المحدودة في عام 1960، جذبت انتباه صديقه، البروفيسور أو. س. زينكيفيتش، الذي كان آنذاك في هيئة التدريس في جامعة نورث ويسترن. بعد بضعة أسابيع من تقديم الورقة، دعا زينكيفيتش كلاف لتقديم ندوة حول طريقة العناصر المحدودة لطلابه. كان زينكيفيتش يُعتبر أحد خبراء العالم في تطبيق طريقة الفروق المحدودة على حل مشاكل ميكانيكا المتصلات في الهندسة المدنية؛ لذلك، كان كلاف مستعداً للنقاش حول المزايا النسبية للطريقتين. ومع ذلك، بعد بضعة أسئلة نافذة حول طريقة العناصر المحدودة، أصبح زينكيفيتش تقريباً متحولاً فورياً إلى الطريقة."

تذكر زدينيك بازانت، الذي كان آنذاك مهندس أبحاث مشارك زائر في جامعة كاليفورنيا بيركلي: "...كان تأسيس FEM ورقة كلاف عام 1960 في مؤتمر ASCE حول الحوسبة الإلكترونية (كلاف (1960))، والتي كانت الأولى التي تشتق، من خلال العمل الافتراضي، مصفوفة صلابة العنصر المحدود لعنصر من متصل (عنصر مثلثي ذو إجهاد ثابت).... أتذكر راي كلاف يعرض لي تقريره عام 1962 إلى منطقة المهندس الأمريكي، ليتل روك، فيلق المهندسين حول تحليله لشرخ لوحظ في سد نورفولك (كلاف (1962))، خلال إقامتي في بيركلي عام 1969. كنت مفتوناً برؤية ذلك التقرير عام 1962. قدم تحليل إجهاد ثنائي الأبعاد لشرخ كبير لوحظ في سد نورفورك. تم تقسيم السد إلى حوالي 200 عنصر مثلثي وقدم محيطات إجهاد لعدد من حالات التحميل.... كان كلاف في ذلك الوقت متقدماً جداً على أي شخص آخر."

لتأكيد ذكريات ز. بازانت، نقتبس سرد إد ويلسون لذلك الجزء من التاريخ: "في عام 1956، أمضى راي وشيرلي وثلاثة أطفال صغار عاماً في النرويج في معهد أبحاث السفن في تروندهايم. كان المهندسون في المعهد يحسبون الإجهادات بسبب اهتزازات السفن من أجل التنبؤ بفشل الإجهاد عند تركيزات الإجهاد. في هذا الوقت أدرك راي أن بحثه حول العناصر يجب أن يسمى طريقة العناصر المحدودة التي يمكن أن تحل العديد من أنواع المشاكل المختلفة في ميكانيكا المتصلات. أدرك راي أن FEM كانت منافساً مباشراً لطريقة الفروق المحدودة. في ذلك الوقت كانت FDM تُستخدم لحل العديد من المشاكل في ميكانيكا المتصلات. عمله السابق في بوينج، طريقة الصلابة المباشرة، كان يُستخدم فقط لحساب الإزاحات وليس الإجهادات.

في فصل الخريف من عام 1957، عاد راي من إجازته التفرغية في النرويج ونشر على الفور صفحة على لوحة إعلانات الطلاب يطلب من الطلاب الاتصال به إذا كانوا مهتمين بإجراء بحث حول العناصر المحدودة لتحليل الأغشية والألواح والأصداف والهياكل الصلبة. على الرغم من أن راي لم يكن لديه تمويل لأبحاث العناصر المحدودة، إلا أن عدداً قليلاً من طلاب الدراسات العليا الذين كان لديهم مصادر أموال أخرى استجابوا. في ذلك الوقت، كان الحاسوب الرقمي الوحيد في كلية الهندسة هو IBM 701 الذي تم إنتاجه في عام 1951 وكان يعتمد على تقنية الأنابيب المفرغة. الحد الأقصى لعدد المعادلات الخطية التي يمكن أن يحلها كان 40. وبالتالي، عندما قدم راي ورقته الأولى حول FEM في سبتمبر 1960، 'طريقة العناصر المحدودة في تحليل الإجهاد المستوي'، في مؤتمر ASCE الثاني حول الحوسبة الإلكترونية في بيتسبرغ، بنسلفانيا، لم يكن توزيع الإجهاد ذو الشبكة الخشنة المُحصّل دقيقاً جداً. لذلك، لم يكن معظم الحضور في المؤتمر متأثرين. بعد تحسين سرعة وقدرة الحواسيب في حرم بيركلي، كانت ورقة البروفيسور كلاف تحليل شبكة دقيقة جداً لسد خرساني موجود. قُدمت الورقة لأول مرة في سبتمبر 1962 في مؤتمر الناتو في لشبونة، البرتغال. في غضون بضعة أشهر، أعيد نشر الورقة في نشرة دولية، كان لها توزيع كبير جداً، بعنوان 'تحليل الإجهاد لسد جاذبية بواسطة طريقة العناصر المحدودة'، (مع إ. ويلسون)، النشرة الدولية RILEM، رقم 10، يونيو 1963."

أفادت ورقة لشبونة عن تحليل العناصر المحدودة لسد نورفورك بارتفاع 250 قدماً في أركنساس، والذي تطور فيه شرخ عمودي أثناء البناء في عام 1942. تنبأ تحليل FEM بشكل صحيح بموقع وحجم الشرخ بسبب تغيرات درجة الحرارة وأنتج إزاحات وإجهادات واقعية داخل السد والأساس لكل من الجاذبية والعديد من ظروف التحميل الهيدروستاتيكي. بسبب هذا النشر، جاء العديد من الطلاب الدوليين والباحثين الزائرين إلى بيركلي للعمل مع البروفيسور كلاف. كما أنه أعطى بحرية قائمة FORTRAN لبرنامج تحليل العناصر المحدودة الخاص بهم لاستخدامه لتقييم الإزاحة والإجهادات في الهياكل المستوية الثنائية الأبعاد الأخرى بهندسات ومواد وأحمال مختلفة. لذلك، يمكن للمهندسين المحترفين استخدام FEM القوية الجديدة بسهولة لحل توزيعات الإجهاد في مشاكل الهندسة الإنشائية الخاصة بهم في ميكانيكا المتصلات. ومع ذلك، لم يستفد من نجاحه في تطوير FEM. عاد إلى مهمة بناء برنامج هندسة الزلازل في بيركلي - المهمة التي أُعطيت له عندما تم توظيفه لأول مرة في عام 1949.

لمساهمته الحاسمة في تطوير FEM، حصل راي ويليام كلاف على وسام العلوم الوطني في عام 1994 من قبل نائب رئيس الولايات المتحدة آنذاك آل جور. اليوم، الإجماع العام هو أن راي كلاف إلى جانب ج. أرجيريس وأو. س. زينكيفيتش قدموا أهم المساهمات في تطوير طريقة العناصر المحدودة بعد العمل الرياضي الأولي لريتشارد كورانت.

جدير بالذكر أن إ. ل. ويلسون من جامعة كاليفورنيا بيركلي كان أول شخص يطور برمجيات مفتوحة المصدر للعناصر المحدودة. ذكر مقتطف من ورقة كلاف وويلسون عام 1999: "في عام 1958، بدأ ويلسون، تحت إشراف كلاف، تطوير برنامج عناصر محدودة آلي يعتمد على عنصر الإجهاد المستوي المستطيل المطور في بوينج. بعد عدة أشهر من تعلم برمجة IBM 701، أنتج ويلسون برنامجاً شبه آلي بقدرة محدودة يعتمد على طريقة القوة. تم إنتاج تقرير بحثي لدرجة الماجستير، والذي فُقد منذ فترة طويلة، بالعنوان التقريبي 'التحليل الحاسوبي لهياكل الإجهاد المستوي'.... في عام 1959، تم تركيب حاسوب IBM 704 في حرم بيركلي. كان لديه ذاكرة 32K من 32 بت ووحدة حساب نقطة عائمة كانت أسرع بحوالي 100 مرة من IBM 701. هذا جعل من الممكن حل الهياكل العملية باستخدام شبكات دقيقة."

من الجدير بالذكر أيضاً أنه في عام 1963، كتب آي. تي. أودين، وهو مهندس إنشائي كبير في قسم البحث والتطوير في شركة جنرال ديناميكس في فورت وورث في ذلك الوقت، تقريراً تقنياً شاملاً من 163 صفحة مع ج. س. بيست، حيث طورا قائمة طويلة من العناصر المحدودة الصلبة والهيكلية، بما في ذلك العنصر الرباعي السطوح، والعنصر السداسي السطوح، وعنصر اللوحة الرقيقة، وعنصر اللوحة السميكة، وعنصر اللوحة مع الدعامات أو المقويات، وعناصر لوحة الساندويتش المركبة، وعناصر القشرة الضحلة (بيست وأودين (1963)). في الواقع، كتب أودين وبيست أحد أوائل أكواد الحاسوب للعناصر المحدودة للأغراض العامة في ذلك الوقت. كان لكود FEM بلغة Fortran الذي طوره أودين وبيست مكتبة عناصر تتضمن عناصر للمرونة ثلاثية الأبعاد، والمرونة المستوية الثنائية الأبعاد، وعناصر العوارض والقضبان ثلاثية الأبعاد، وعناصر اللوحة والقشرة الطبقية المركبة، وعناصر للمواد المركبة العامة. تضمن عملهم أيضاً طرقاً هجينة وFEM قائمة على الإجهاد، والتي قد تكون حتى أقدم من تلك الخاصة ببيان (بيان (1964)). علاوة على ذلك، كود FEM لأودين وبيست قادر أيضاً على التعامل مع تحليل القيمة الذاتية النمطي لـ FEM، والتكاملات العددية على عناصر المثلث ورباعي السطوح، وكان لديه حلول أنظمة خطية للتحليل الساكن العام لـ FEM كانت من بين الأكثر فعالية في ذلك الوقت. تم استخدام كود الحاسوب FEM هذا لسنوات عديدة في تحليل وتصميم الطائرات في صناعة الطيران والدفاع.

من حيث الاهتمام البحثي العالمي، بحلول عام 1965، أصبح بحث العناصر المحدودة مجالاً نشطاً للغاية، حيث تجاوز العدد الإجمالي للأوراق المنشورة في الأدبيات 1000. خلال هذه الفترة، كان هناك حدثان يبدوان غير مرتبطين بتطوير FEM، لكنهما أثرا بشكل كبير على التطورات المستقبلية لـ FEM. كانت هذه الأحداث هي اكتشاف المبادئ التغايرية المختلطة في المرونة. في عام 1950، أعاد إ. رايسنر اكتشاف مبدأ إ. هيلينجر التغايري المختلط من عام 1914، حيث يكون كل من حقل الإزاحة وحقل الإجهاد هما المجهولات الأساسية. يُسمى هذا المبدأ التغايري مبدأ هيلينجر-رايسنر التغايري. بعد ذلك بفترة وجيزة، اقترح ه. هو في عام 1954 وك. واشيزو في عام 1955 مبدأ تغايري مختلط ثلاثي الحقول في المرونة، والذي سُمي مبدأ هو-واشيزو التغايري. في وقت مبكر من عام 1964، أدرك ثيودور ه. ه. بيان إمكانية استخدام هذه المبادئ التغايرية لصياغة صيغ العناصر المحدودة القائمة على شكل جالركين الضعيف واقترح طريقة العناصر المحدودة للإجهاد المفترض. بدأ هذا استخدام المبادئ التغايرية المختلطة لصياغة طرق العناصر المحدودة جالركين، والتي تبعتها طريقة العناصر المحدودة للإجهاد المفترض التي طورها خوان سيمو وزملاؤه في الفترة اللاحقة من تطورات العناصر المحدودة.
