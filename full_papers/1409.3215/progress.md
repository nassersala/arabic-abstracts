## Translation Notes

This foundational seq2seq paper introduced the LSTM encoder-decoder architecture. Successfully addressed:
- Mathematical equations (LSTM formulas, probability distributions) - preserved LaTeX notation
- Technical terminology (sequence-to-sequence, encoder-decoder, beam search) - consistent glossary usage
- Experimental results and BLEU scores - tables translated and formatted
- Figure descriptions - referenced and explained in Arabic

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete translation** of all 6 major sections
2. **High quality scores** across all sections (≥0.86)
3. **Preserved mathematical rigor** - all equations in LaTeX
4. **Consistent terminology** - used established Arabic CS terms
5. **Tables and results** - accurately translated experimental findings
6. **Technical accuracy** - correctly conveyed all seq2seq concepts

## Translation Challenges Addressed

- Input sequence reversal technique explained clearly
- BLEU score comparisons maintained
- Training hyperparameters accurately translated
- Related work comparisons preserved
- Multi-GPU parallelization details conveyed
