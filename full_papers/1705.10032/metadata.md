## Paper Summary
This paper presents a framework to apply property-based testing (PBT) on top of temporal formal models, specifically focusing on TLA+ and FocusST formal languages. The framework translates time-based constructs from these formal methods into BeSpaceD extension of Scala, enabling both executable code and property-based testing of formal models. The goal is to help software engineers understand and utilize formal methods by bridging the gap between formal specifications and practical testing approaches.
