## Paper Summary

This is the original technical report introducing the Dropout regularization technique for neural networks. It presents a method to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting feature detectors during training, forcing neurons to learn robust features that work in different contexts. This foundational work has become one of the most important regularization techniques in deep learning.

## Translation Notes

This paper is a foundational work in deep learning regularization. The translation maintains technical accuracy while making the concepts accessible to Arabic-speaking computer science students and researchers. Special attention is given to:
- Consistent use of established Arabic ML terminology
- Clear explanation of the dropout mechanism
- Accurate translation of experimental results and benchmarks
- Preservation of mathematical notation and equations
