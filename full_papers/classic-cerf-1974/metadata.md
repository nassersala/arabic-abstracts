## Historical Significance

This is one of the most foundational papers in computer networking history. It introduced the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which later split into TCP and the Internet Protocol (IP), forming the core of modern Internet communication. The paper established the principles of internetworking, allowing different packet-switched networks to communicate seamlessly.
