## Paper Significance

This is one of the most influential papers in computer graphics history. Turner Whitted introduced recursive ray tracing, which revolutionized realistic image synthesis. The paper presented the first practical algorithm for simulating:
- Mirror reflections
- Transparent refractions
- Shadows
- Anti-aliasing through supersampling

The "ray tree" concept introduced in this paper became the foundation for physically-based rendering and path tracing algorithms that power modern computer graphics, from movies to video games.

**Awards:** ACM SIGGRAPH Steven A. Coons Award (2013)
