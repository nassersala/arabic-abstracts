## Translation Notes

### Section Breakdown
- **Section 2 (Approach)** contains subsections on:
  - 2.1: Models
  - 2.2: Training data
  - 2.3: Training process
  - 2.4: Evaluation methodology (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot)

- **Section 3 (Results)** covers extensive evaluations including:
  - 3.9: Novel tasks designed to probe in-context learning

### Key Challenges
- **Length:** 75 pages - one of the longest papers to translate
- **Technical depth:** Extensive experimental results and analysis
- **Mathematical content:** Model architecture, training details, evaluation metrics
- **Broader impacts:** Requires careful translation of societal implications

### Strategy
Given the paper's length, we'll break the translation into manageable sections:
1. Start with Abstract (copy from translations)
2. Introduction (foundational context)
3. Approach (technical methodology)
4. Results (may need to be split into subsections if too long)
5. Continue with remaining sections

**Target:** Complete 1-2 sections per session
**Estimated sessions needed:** 6-8 sessions
