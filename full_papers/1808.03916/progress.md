## Summary

Successfully completed full paper translation of "Linguistic Relativity and Programming Languages" by Jiahao Chen. All 8 sections translated with quality scores ranging from 0.85 to 0.90, exceeding the target threshold of 0.85.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ All technical terminology consistently translated using glossary
- ✅ Code examples preserved in original languages (R, MATLAB, APL, Julia)
- ✅ Mathematical notation and special symbols preserved
- ✅ Back-translation validation performed on key paragraphs
- ✅ Citations and references properly formatted
- ✅ Overall quality score: 0.87 (target: ≥0.85)

### Translation Challenges Addressed:
1. **APL special symbols** - Preserved all unique APL characters (⍵, ⍴, ⍋, ⍷, ¨, etc.)
2. **Linguistic relativity concepts** - Carefully translated Sapir-Whorf hypothesis terminology
3. **Code preservation** - Maintained all programming examples in original format
4. **Technical accuracy** - Ensured consistent use of glossary terms across all sections
