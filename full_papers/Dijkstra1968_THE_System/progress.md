## Translation Notes

This paper is a foundational work in operating system design (6 pages total in CACM 1968).
Sections are organized based on the paper's logical structure:
1. Introduction and motivation
2. Storage allocation (memory abstraction)
3. Processor allocation and synchronization
4. The hierarchical system structure (6 levels)
5. Design methodology and testing approach
6. Concluding remarks

Key technical terms to maintain consistency:
- multiprogramming (البرمجة المتعددة)
- sequential processes (العمليات التسلسلية)
- hierarchical levels (المستويات الهرمية)
- abstraction (التجريد)
- semaphores (السيمافورات)
- segment (المقطع)
- page (الصفحة)
- mutual exclusion (الاستبعاد المتبادل)

## Summary

**Translation Completed:** 2025-11-15
**Total Sections:** 7 (abstract + 6 main sections)
**Average Quality Score:** 0.881

**Key Achievements:**
- All sections translated with quality ≥0.85
- Consistent use of glossary terms throughout
- Preserved technical accuracy and historical context
- Maintained formal academic Arabic style
- All mathematical and technical concepts accurately conveyed

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Translating 1960s hardware terminology (drum, core memory)
- Conveying the revolutionary nature of hierarchical design for that era
- Explaining semaphores and P/V operations clearly
- Balancing literal translation with readability in Arabic

**Historical Significance Preserved:**
- Emphasized this as one of the first layered OS architectures
- Highlighted the formal verification approach (revolutionary for 1968)
- Connected historical contributions to modern OS design principles
- Preserved Dijkstra's insights on design methodology
